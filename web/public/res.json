The relevance of the opening isn't explained for some time as the movie shifts gears to a detailed look into the life of Michael Burrows, a criminal profiler for the San Francisco Police Department. Much of the film is shot in a documentary style, ostensibly as a part of a dissertation by a film school grad who follows Michael through the movie. Fired from the force after his haemophobia lets a murderer get away, he drifts about in a deep depression for several weeks before coming up with a way to combine his obsession with the Darwin Awards with his talent for profiling: help insurance companies detect, before they're sold insurance policies, people that are likely to end their own lives accidentally. After impressing a manager at the insurance company with his talent for profiling, he's paired up with Siri, a specialist in 'weird' insurance cases.Siri and Michael travel the country investigating several legendary examples of stupidity on behalf of the insurance company, such as the above mentioned JATO rocket car, not all of which would qualify as 'Darwin Awards'. For example, a pair of men who are attempting to ice fish get frustrated and try to use a stick of dynamite to blast a hole in the ice only to have their trusty black lab fetch the stick of dynamite, run back to their brand-new SUV, and sink it to the bottom of the lake without either man being killed. As they investigate those and other cases, Michael tries to find a common factor in these people; the closest the movie gets to an explanation is a confused monologue by Siri about insurance companies always denying claims and driving people insane.Ironically, Michael narrowly avoids becoming a Darwin Award winner throughout the movie. In one instance, he and Siri are stranded out in the middle of nowhere on a cold winter night. Desperate for warmth, he attempts to set a fire with gasoline to get warm only to blow up his own car. In a later scene, Siri confronts Michael, accusing him of being so obsessed with the Darwin Award winners because he suspects he's one of them.A twist of fate leads to Michael finding out where the murder suspect he let get away lives. As he attempts to videotape the man in his home by rappelling down the side of his building, the film school student is seen for the first time. He, too, is hanging on the side of the building by a rope- with the other end of the same rope Michael is dangling by. The stone vase the pair is anchored by inches closer to the edge as the serial killer taunts them from the roof, slicing open his own hand in an effort to trigger Michael's haemophobia. Michael is able to overcome his haemophobia, defeat the serial killer, and live happily ever after with Siri.-----------KrystelClaire's summaryThe film opens with desert scenery, and within it, a secondary road. A dude with a pink sports car uses a JATO engine to drive. Fade to black, and sound of the car crashing onto something.A voiceover explains the idea behind the Darwin Awards, given to people who did something so stupid which killed them, and so, removing themselves from the possibility of passing their dumb genes onto their offspring. Cut to a skyscraper, where aggressive executive Chris Hunter (Alessandro Nivola) shows off to two of his friends (Ross Patterson & Russell Steinberg) to prove that the glass is unbreakable and bullet-proof. He takes a cushion and jumps... as it happens to his death.Cut to Michael Burrows (Joseph Fiennes), a criminal profiler for the San Francisco Police Department. It's decided that a documentary will be done about the way he works, so a cameraman (Wilmer Valderrama) will follow him everywhere. Two other detectives (Adonal Foyle and Tom Wright) wonder if the director should be there. Michael finds him a nuisance. He remembers when he realised that he can focus more than anyone else - on fourth grade, Michael (Max Common) realised that one of his fellow students (Vincent Brubaker) was the culprit of a prank, and so the whole class was punished without going out to the playground for the whole year. The boy hit Michael in front of his friends (Elias Stefanek, Zosha Stefanek & Emma C. Taylor) to make him not betray him, Michael's nose bled, he felt dizzy and passed out. It was found out that he had haemophobia - fear of blood.Michael and the film maker are followed by a serial killer (Tim Blake Nelson). Michael is reading a book about his condition, but as he finds it useless, he throws it in a rubbish bin. He says that he's already done the killer's profile: a short man with literary studies. Michael realises that the killer is following them and he arrests him. As the film maker doesn't want to call the police - he would have to let go of his camera - that gives the opportunity for the killer to attack Burrows. Burrows handcuffs him anyway, but in the ensuing fight, the killer's nose bleeds. Michael passes out, the killer runs away and he punches the film director.The film director keeps on recording Burrows, now expelled from the police because of his illness. Michael keeps on investigating from home - the cue is given by all the bills he has to pay, including insurance. He talks to an insurance executive (Kevin Dunn) to get a job with his company analysing risk-taking people. At first, the exec doesn't pay much attention, but Michael is able to rip his life apart describing every detail: his lovers, his spending habits, his use of slips as underwear which is causing fertility problems for him. Michael thinks that he will be able to profile people who take stupid risks. Michael also gives the example of fat men (R.J. Owens, Bruce Lee Sage & Bob Sáenz) who use soap bars in the shower, and when they try to pick up the bar, they die because they slip in the shower. Finally, the exec decides to give Michael an opportunity, as there are weird cases all over the United States which are costing the company millions. Michael doesn't want to travel, but he has to take the opportunity as it is.He is paired with Siri Taylor (Winona Ryder), who investigates weird death cases. She is investigating a wacko cases in which Emile Travers (Ty Burrell) died in a freak case. There is blood all over the place, so Michael faints once again. The Zippy Cola dispensing machine won't work, so he tries to take the can of cola he's already paid for by introducing his arm through the slot, as he does with another dispensing machine which offers snacks. In the latter case he's successful, and steals a snack. He gets stuck, and the shopping mall where he's at closes for the night - and one of the cleaning men can't help him because he's wearing huge headphones as protection against the noise of the cleaning machine. Moreover, the mall is closing for the whole weekend. So Emile tries to pull his arm out. He finally succeeds in releasing himself, but the dispensing machine stumbles back and forth, and finally falls to the ground, smashing Emile as though he were a bug. As with the case of the jumping executive, Michael can picture himself being in that person's shoes doing the weird things that person did. Michael guessed that she had counted the coins and then falls to the ground.Siri thinks that the legs of the Zippy Cola machine were faulty, so the insurance company will have to pay, but Michael proves otherwise, saving Zippy Cola millions of dollars.Then, they go to Olson, Minnesota, to prove that the car robbery was fake, because in 32 there weren't any robberies there. Michael takes his own cutlery with him.Michael focuses on the display fish on the wall of the owner of the stolen 4x4, Mr. Bob Sparrow (Max Perlich) while his wife Mrs. Sparrow (Mary Saudargas) offers them tea and biscuits. The only description he gives of the criminals is \"weird men from the city\". They go to a frozen lake. As Siri believes that accidents happen out of the blue, they argue. Siri walks on the ice; she slips down and lands on her back - that way, she realises that there's a frozen fish in a tree. Mr Sparrow is going through his midlife crisis, and buys the expensive car. One drinking day spent with his buddy Tom (Chris Penn), bored to death, and they decide to use dynamite to fish out of boredom. They are crappy dynamite users, so they use one to break the ice. But the dog of one of them brings them their dynamite. They run away, they even try to shoot the dog Max, but Max leaves the dynamite under the brand new car. When it explodes, that's the end of the car, and Mr Sparrow falls onto the hole and into the freezing water river. His buddy tries to take him out using his shotgun, which wounds him a little bit. So they throw it in the lake, which immediately freezes again. The police take the car out of the river. Michael thinks that Siri found the key to the crime with sheer luck, but Siri says that sometimes to have to take the risk of making a fool of yourself to accomplish things. Michael thinks that bravery equals stupidity many times.Michael and Siri visit the wounded friend onto hospital.They leave for Wendover, Nevada to investigate the disappearance of the wacko driver from the beginning. If they prove that there was a suicide attempt, there's no obligation for the company to pay.Harvey Weston (David Arquette) likes shooting at old cars with his friend Stan (Brad Hunt).He's the man driving the pink car at the beginning. They are close to a gas station where Joleen (Juliette Lewis) works. Harvey admires a flashy red sports car. Joleen and Harvey make love, and Michael imagines himself making love to Joleen.Harvey and Stan buy Army tools from two ex-Army soldiers (Myth Busters Adam Savage &Jamie Hyneman). There are grenades, masks... but they finally buy the engine of a military jet. Harvey drives the car with the intention of \"being on TV\". The engine is designed to empower jets of 200 tonnes, but Harvey's Chevrolet was only two. The car ended being at 650 kilometers per hour. He can't stop the car because the tyres melt at 400 km/h and the hand brake is ineffectual. He turns right, which causes the car to fly at 30 meters high until it crashes against a small steep. Mr. Pearlman (Richmond Arquette) watches it, and thinks it's a UFO. Mrs Pearlman (Nora Dunn) thinks that her husband is eccentric, and that he was distracted by they two quarrelling children (Allie Busch & Matthew Busch). The married couple talk to Siri and Michael. Siri refuses to pay insurance for somebody who has done such a daredevil thing.They argue. Siri kisses him passionately to give him an opportunity to talk to a cashier called Zoe (Robin Tunney), pretending to split up with Siri. Siri thinks Zoe is desperate for sex and that she'll offer some \"consolation\" to Michael.Michael ties himself with a weird harness in the shower, but it gets stuck. As usual, the film director won't help him, so Siri, in revenge, showers his camera. At that moment is when Joy phones him. Michael tells her he'll phone her in a minute, and Siri leaves him there.Siri thinks that Michael is obsessed with the Darwin Awards because he's afraid he'll die in a stupid way.A female executive, Carla (Julianna Margulies), in a plane is shown how the automatic pilot works by the pilot (Rod Arrants) himself. That gives her an idea: while driving a van she leaves the driving seat. She turns the automatic pilot on and then gives a blow job to her lover Henry (Tom Hollander). They cause a car driver (Debbie Brubaker) and a lorry driver to swerve wildly. The van crashes into a dentist (Josh Kornbluth)'s office, who was trying to calm down a panicky patient, Mr. Harris (Mickey Breitenstein). The intrusion of the van causes the dentist to hurt Mr Harries, who sues him. However, the marks of the executive's teeth on the dick of her partner are proof enough.They drive to another location; they get lost and stuck in the middle of nowhere. Siri's phone is out of battery. Michael's phone flies away because he was trying to get some network. They try to fight the cold night by burning some petrol, thus setting fire to the whole car. Only when the batteries of the camera are dead will the film director take the trouble to use his working mobile phone with network. Siri and Michael hit him for not speaking before.In Tacoma, Washington. Michael mentions two people who bring disgrace to others, but who are themselves immune to harm. Simon (Judah Friedlander) and his buddy Farley (Lukas Haas) go to a Metallica concert in a dirty van and already drinking some beer. Simon's mother (Nancy Clausen) wonders whether Simon has stolen money from her purse. They have to wait outside because the contact who is supposed to sell them their tickets doesn't show up. They try to buy the tickets from two fans (Jason Foster & Lindsay Benner) by giving them 200 bucks, marijuana and even their van. Simon remembers how Lisa Cummings sucked him off in that van, but complains that he's still a virgin.They try to jump the wall inside the concert's venue. Simon ends up hanging in a tree. He cuts the wing of the tree with his knife, intending to fall onto a bush. They smoke some joints while doing that. Finally, Simon falls onto his own knife. Farley pulls Simon tying him to the van with a rope. But when he's about to pull him, a spark from his joint falls onto his trousers. Waving his arms and legs trying to put that out, Farley leads the van to fall on top of Simon, squashing him. The members of Metallica stop playing and stare at the weird view of the falling van. The driver survives, but Simon is squashed like a bug.At the Deer Glen Motel, Michael smokes a joint to inspire himself. Michael is frustrated because he can't find any link to all those weird deaths. His job is secure, though, because he's saving the company so much money, as Siri tells him. Siri says that all the procedures in the insurance company lead to people quitting on fair claims.Michael fights with two bar patrons (Jerry Harrison & John Doe) who laugh about Harvey Weston and Sparrow. Siri is haunted by all those weird deaths, but she tells Michael that he should try to forget it all. The film director is imprisoned in the bathroom so that he can't record their conversation. They kiss and make love.Siri doesn't give any importance to that sexual relationship. Michael analyses her passion for one-night stands because her father abandoned her when she was a child. She pretends to cut herself to show the blood to him. He falls to the floor but then, it was only ketchup. A couple who are reading books (Michael Horowitz & Cynthia Horowitz) asks him whether he's all right.The cameraman advises Michael to forget about Siri. At that moment, in their hotel room, Michael watches a reporter (Mike Sugerman) talking about the serial killer who has just killed again in South Beach. He realises that the victims were all reading books. He asks the film director to check that clue in his videotapes. The killer was carrying a beat poet's book in his pocket.Michael leaves for San Francisco and an ex-workmate lets him in. The film director phones Siri, who watches the scene and describes it to him.They go to Lawrence Ferlinghetti's book shop. When they finally talk to him, they lead him to a weird book buyer who tries to pass as a beatnik.Michael hangs himself from a rope and records with the director's heavy camera the killer's apartment from a window. His bloodied boots are there. Siri insists on calling the police, but Michael refuses. The film director hangs himself as well with a smaller lighter camera, which proves to be too heavy for the stone fountain which they have tied the rope to. They tell Siri to go up to the rooftop and secure the fountain.The killer watches them and he goes up to the rooftop and attacks Siri there, who is putting more weight inside the stone decoration. Michael gives his heavy camera to the film director. The imbalance in the weight makes the film director go down and Michael up. He reaches the rooftop and pulls the killer, holding onto his shirt. They all reach the street softly because of the new weight imbalance.Once there, the killer asks Michael why he didn't kill him by letting him go from a height, but Michael said that it was just a reflex on his part. However, the decoration mold falls down onto the killer, who just says that he won't ever go on a drinking binge again. The killer is squashed.The film director gets onto the ambulance recording it. The paramedic (Josh Charles) doesn't want to let him record because of the insurance, but Michael and Siri won't tell on himMetallica dedicates a song to Simon, while his friend watches it from backstage in a wheelchair. He's so dumb that he lights a lighter close to the pyrotechnics which are to be used later for the concert.","description_full":"The movie opens with a shot of a man in a car with a JATO rocket strapped to it.

The relevance of the opening isn't explained for some time as the movie shifts gears to a detailed look into the life of Michael Burrows, a criminal profiler for the San Francisco Police Department. Much of the film is shot in a documentary style, ostensibly as a part of a dissertation by a film school grad who follows Michael through the movie. Fired from the force after his haemophobia lets a murderer get away, he drifts about in a deep depression for several weeks before coming up with a way to combine his obsession with the Darwin Awards with his talent for profiling: help insurance companies detect, before they're sold insurance policies, people that are likely to end their own lives accidentally. After impressing a manager at the insurance company with his talent for profiling, he's paired up with Siri, a specialist in 'weird' insurance cases.Siri and Michael travel the country investigating several legendary examples of stupidity on behalf of the insurance company, such as the above mentioned JATO rocket car, not all of which would qualify as 'Darwin Awards'. For example, a pair of men who are attempting to ice fish get frustrated and try to use a stick of dynamite to blast a hole in the ice only to have their trusty black lab fetch the stick of dynamite, run back to their brand-new SUV, and sink it to the bottom of the lake without either man being killed. As they investigate those and other cases, Michael tries to find a common factor in these people; the closest the movie gets to an explanation is a confused monologue by Siri about insurance companies always denying claims and driving people insane.Ironically, Michael narrowly avoids becoming a Darwin Award winner throughout the movie. In one instance, he and Siri are stranded out in the middle of nowhere on a cold winter night. Desperate for warmth, he attempts to set a fire with gasoline to get warm only to blow up his own car. In a later scene, Siri confronts Michael, accusing him of being so obsessed with the Darwin Award winners because he suspects he's one of them.A twist of fate leads to Michael finding out where the murder suspect he let get away lives. As he attempts to videotape the man in his home by rappelling down the side of his building, the film school student is seen for the first time. He, too, is hanging on the side of the building by a rope- with the other end of the same rope Michael is dangling by. The stone vase the pair is anchored by inches closer to the edge as the serial killer taunts them from the roof, slicing open his own hand in an effort to trigger Michael's haemophobia. Michael is able to overcome his haemophobia, defeat the serial killer, and live happily ever after with Siri.-----------KrystelClaire's summaryThe film opens with desert scenery, and within it, a secondary road. A dude with a pink sports car uses a JATO engine to drive. Fade to black, and sound of the car crashing onto something.A voiceover explains the idea behind the Darwin Awards, given to people who did something so stupid which killed them, and so, removing themselves from the possibility of passing their dumb genes onto their offspring. Cut to a skyscraper, where aggressive executive Chris Hunter (Alessandro Nivola) shows off to two of his friends (Ross Patterson & Russell Steinberg) to prove that the glass is unbreakable and bullet-proof. He takes a cushion and jumps... as it happens to his death.Cut to Michael Burrows (Joseph Fiennes), a criminal profiler for the San Francisco Police Department. It's decided that a documentary will be done about the way he works, so a cameraman (Wilmer Valderrama) will follow him everywhere. Two other detectives (Adonal Foyle and Tom Wright) wonder if the director should be there. Michael finds him a nuisance. He remembers when he realised that he can focus more than anyone else - on fourth grade, Michael (Max Common) realised that one of his fellow students (Vincent Brubaker) was the culprit of a prank, and so the whole class was punished without going out to the playground for the whole year. The boy hit Michael in front of his friends (Elias Stefanek, Zosha Stefanek & Emma C. Taylor) to make him not betray him, Michael's nose bled, he felt dizzy and passed out. It was found out that he had haemophobia - fear of blood.Michael and the film maker are followed by a serial killer (Tim Blake Nelson). Michael is reading a book about his condition, but as he finds it useless, he throws it in a rubbish bin. He says that he's already done the killer's profile: a short man with literary studies. Michael realises that the killer is following them and he arrests him. As the film maker doesn't want to call the police - he would have to let go of his camera - that gives the opportunity for the killer to attack Burrows. Burrows handcuffs him anyway, but in the ensuing fight, the killer's nose bleeds. Michael passes out, the killer runs away and he punches the film director.The film director keeps on recording Burrows, now expelled from the police because of his illness. Michael keeps on investigating from home - the cue is given by all the bills he has to pay, including insurance. He talks to an insurance executive (Kevin Dunn) to get a job with his company analysing risk-taking people. At first, the exec doesn't pay much attention, but Michael is able to rip his life apart describing every detail: his lovers, his spending habits, his use of slips as underwear which is causing fertility problems for him. Michael thinks that he will be able to profile people who take stupid risks. Michael also gives the example of fat men (R.J. Owens, Bruce Lee Sage & Bob Sáenz) who use soap bars in the shower, and when they try to pick up the bar, they die because they slip in the shower. Finally, the exec decides to give Michael an opportunity, as there are weird cases all over the United States which are costing the company millions. Michael doesn't want to travel, but he has to take the opportunity as it is.He is paired with Siri Taylor (Winona Ryder), who investigates weird death cases. She is investigating a wacko cases in which Emile Travers (Ty Burrell) died in a freak case. There is blood all over the place, so Michael faints once again. The Zippy Cola dispensing machine won't work, so he tries to take the can of cola he's already paid for by introducing his arm through the slot, as he does with another dispensing machine which offers snacks. In the latter case he's successful, and steals a snack. He gets stuck, and the shopping mall where he's at closes for the night - and one of the cleaning men can't help him because he's wearing huge headphones as protection against the noise of the cleaning machine. Moreover, the mall is closing for the whole weekend. So Emile tries to pull his arm out. He finally succeeds in releasing himself, but the dispensing machine stumbles back and forth, and finally falls to the ground, smashing Emile as though he were a bug. As with the case of the jumping executive, Michael can picture himself being in that person's shoes doing the weird things that person did. Michael guessed that she had counted the coins and then falls to the ground.Siri thinks that the legs of the Zippy Cola machine were faulty, so the insurance company will have to pay, but Michael proves otherwise, saving Zippy Cola millions of dollars.Then, they go to Olson, Minnesota, to prove that the car robbery was fake, because in 32 there weren't any robberies there. Michael takes his own cutlery with him.Michael focuses on the display fish on the wall of the owner of the stolen 4x4, Mr. Bob Sparrow (Max Perlich) while his wife Mrs. Sparrow (Mary Saudargas) offers them tea and biscuits. The only description he gives of the criminals is \"weird men from the city\". They go to a frozen lake. As Siri believes that accidents happen out of the blue, they argue. Siri walks on the ice; she slips down and lands on her back - that way, she realises that there's a frozen fish in a tree. Mr Sparrow is going through his midlife crisis, and buys the expensive car. One drinking day spent with his buddy Tom (Chris Penn), bored to death, and they decide to use dynamite to fish out of boredom. They are crappy dynamite users, so they use one to break the ice. But the dog of one of them brings them their dynamite. They run away, they even try to shoot the dog Max, but Max leaves the dynamite under the brand new car. When it explodes, that's the end of the car, and Mr Sparrow falls onto the hole and into the freezing water river. His buddy tries to take him out using his shotgun, which wounds him a little bit. So they throw it in the lake, which immediately freezes again. The police take the car out of the river. Michael thinks that Siri found the key to the crime with sheer luck, but Siri says that sometimes to have to take the risk of making a fool of yourself to accomplish things. Michael thinks that bravery equals stupidity many times.Michael and Siri visit the wounded friend onto hospital.They leave for Wendover, Nevada to investigate the disappearance of the wacko driver from the beginning. If they prove that there was a suicide attempt, there's no obligation for the company to pay.Harvey Weston (David Arquette) likes shooting at old cars with his friend Stan (Brad Hunt).He's the man driving the pink car at the beginning. They are close to a gas station where Joleen (Juliette Lewis) works. Harvey admires a flashy red sports car. Joleen and Harvey make love, and Michael imagines himself making love to Joleen.Harvey and Stan buy Army tools from two ex-Army soldiers (Myth Busters Adam Savage &Jamie Hyneman). There are grenades, masks... but they finally buy the engine of a military jet. Harvey drives the car with the intention of \"being on TV\". The engine is designed to empower jets of 200 tonnes, but Harvey's Chevrolet was only two. The car ended being at 650 kilometers per hour. He can't stop the car because the tyres melt at 400 km/h and the hand brake is ineffectual. He turns right, which causes the car to fly at 30 meters high until it crashes against a small steep. Mr. Pearlman (Richmond Arquette) watches it, and thinks it's a UFO. Mrs Pearlman (Nora Dunn) thinks that her husband is eccentric, and that he was distracted by they two quarrelling children (Allie Busch & Matthew Busch). The married couple talk to Siri and Michael. Siri refuses to pay insurance for somebody who has done such a daredevil thing.They argue. Siri kisses him passionately to give him an opportunity to talk to a cashier called Zoe (Robin Tunney), pretending to split up with Siri.

creation of rock, but arguably no single piece of music was more influential than the 1958 instrumental \"Rumble\" by American Indian rock guitarist and singer/songwriter Link Wray.When recalling Link Wray's shivering guitar classic, \"Rumble,\" Martin Scorsese marvels, \"It is the sound of that guitar . . . that aggression.\" \"Rumble\" was the first song to use distortion and feedback.

A tour of the places that mean the most to Maradona offer a unique look at the way the soccer star was shaped by his surroundings, and conversations with the people closest to him offer a unique glimpse into his colorful personality. A conversation with Cuban leader Fidel Castro highlights how even the most powerful personalities become awestruck while speaking with Maradona. This is Kusturica's most expressive in form and the most radical in content since at least Black Cat, White Cat where Kusturica values Maradona not only as a virtuoso player but as man with a political view.","synopsis":"This is Maradona as the two-time Palme Dor winner Emir Kusturica sees him: the revolutionary, the footballer, the man, the God, the family man, the drug-addict, the legend.

He soon learns the academic challenge is formidable, many boys being still illiterate, but gradually earns their trust, respect, in time almost devotion, with 'paternal' kindness, making the layman the opposite of the cruel prefect, brother John, who frequently administers painful and humiliating punishments, even the gentle, old superior Father Damian has no authority against his disciplinary mandate from the grim bishop Conlon. Slowly even class rebel Liam Mercier is turned around, trough his gift for literature. After Franklin dares stop the sadist's penny-weighted strap severely striking 'sinful scum' for a futility, the whole dorm is treated to an icy night outdoors, arms outstretched wearing only shorts.

These films are in fact the first cinematographic record, the first \"gaze\" in the philosophical sense, into the soul of the region. As the title implies, the story will take the form of an odyssey that begins in Greece and continues through Albania (the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, known to the Greeks as the Republic of Skopje), Bulgaria, Rumania, Serbia, and finally Bosnia.The film opens with an old black and white silent film that shows some village women weaving. In a voice-over, Harvey Keitel comments, \"Weavers in Avdella, a Greek Village, 1905, the first film made by the brothers Miltiades and Yannakis Manakis, [who filmed] all the ambiguities, the contrasts, the conflicts in this area of the world.\" For those of you who would watch \"Ulysses' Gaze\" only to find out if these three films ever existed, you now know the answer, and you don't have to watch to the end. But if you follow the advice of the Greek poet C. P. Cavafi, in his poem \"Ithaca\" (1911): \"When you start on your journey to Ithaca, / then pray that the road is long, / full of adventure, full of knowledge\", then you will enjoy the next 180 minutes of the journey.Following this antique piece of film showing the weaving village women, and before the opening titles, we see a small masterpiece of a scene, as only Angelopoulos can produce. An old man, standing on a quay, is getting his old-type camera ready to film a sailing ship coming out of the harbor of Salonika. The old man is Yannakis Manakis, and the scene, which took place in 1954, is recounted to \"A\" out of the camera's field of view by an old man who had been Manakis's assistant at that time. The assistant is not shown as he would have been at the time, but as he is today. While we watch Manakis finish preparing his camera and his assistant standing behind him recounting the event, the films takes on color. As the blue ship appears on the right side of the screen, Manakis is struck by a heart attack and collapses in a chair. The assistant walks toward the right of the screen, all the while continuing with his story. The camera scans to the right, and we discover \"A\" standing. \"A\" walks leftward, passing the point where we had just seen Manakis and his camera, but they are no longer there. We continue following \"A\" walking to the left, until the blue ship reappears in the field of view. The camera now follows the ship, slowly zooming in, until the ship stands still and fills the screen. Eventually, the camera stops tracking the ship and it disappears to the left. We are contemplating a blue-grey sea that dissolves into a sky of the same color. In his long shot, Angelopoulos has covered sixty years, and set the tone for the whole journey.As the film begins, \"A\" (Harvey Keitel) has arrived in a rainy Florina, a town in northern Greece, where one of his films is to be shown. The film is somehow controversial, and religious fanatics plan to demonstrate against its screening. One of the screening organizers advises \"A\" to leave town for his own safety. As \"A\" is about to enter a taxi, a woman (Maia Morgenstern) in her thirties passes him by and \"A,\" apparently stunned, follows her, muttering to himself: \"I did not expect you here.\" She disappears between the groups of demonstrators and counter-demonstrators who face each other. Morgenstern, who plays the roles of four different women in the film, is \"A's\" old love whom he left years ago, and therefore, a Penelope figure. The two groups rush toward each other, but the resulting confrontation is left unseen.Cut to a dreary winter day, with snow on the ground. \"A\" arrives at an Albanian border crossing in a taxi. While the taxi driver (Thanassis Vengos) tends to the police formalities, \"A\" notices an older lady (Dora Volanaki) with a suitcase standing nearby. \"A\" walks toward her, and she asks if he could give her a lift to a town over the border. She plans to visit her sister, whom she has not seen for forty-five years. \"A\" agrees and helps her into the taxi. Just then, a group of people arrives in a bus: they are illegal Albanian immigrants who were rounded up by the Greek police and are being return to their home country. As \"A's\" taxi proceeds across the Albanian side of the border, we see all along the road, in a desolate and gloomy snowy landscape, hundreds of Albanians standing like statues, waiting for a chance to sneak into Greece. The taxi reaches the town of Korytsa, stops in the middle of an empty square, and \"A\" helps the lady out. The taxi leaves, and a tracking-back long shot reveals the isolation and desolation of the town.The taxi continues toward the Macedonian border, but it has to stop because of snow on the road. The friendly taxi driver sensibly decides against a perilous crossing, and settles down, waiting for the snow to be cleared. He engages \"A\" in a conversation while listening to Greek music and drinking. He says, \"Greece is dying.We are dying as a people,\" reflecting on the present situation of Greece and its people.\"A\" arrives, apparently on a bus in Monastiri, in the Republic of Skopje. He is looking for the original home of the Manakis brothers. He stands in front of the door, and the film dissolves into old black and white footage made around 1956 by the Manakis brothers. The house is now a museum, and \"A\" enters. Inside, he briefly meets with a young lady (Maia Morgenstern), who gives him the cold shoulder. Later that evening, on the train to Skopje, \"A\" meets her again. He explains in detail his journey's purpose, and we learn that the young woman's name is Kali, which stands for Calypso, the goddess who held Ulysses captive for seven years on her island, Ogygia.. Kali tells \"A\" that the Manakis' films are not in the Skopje film archives. In Skopje, \"A\" is continuing on by train to Bulgaria and Kali is on the platform. \"A\" recounts to her an event he witnessed two years earlier on the island of Delos. The train has started leaving the station and is picking up speed. Kali is running on the platform alongside the train, fascinated by \"A's\" story. Finally, \"A\" grabs her and pulls her aboard. He continues his story, and Kali is so moved by it that she does not resist \"A's\" passionate embrace. She will now share \"A's\" journey.The train pulls in the station at the border. \"A\" and Kali are asked to step down -- apparently, there is something wrong with \"A's\" passport. Past and present mix once more: the train station alters and \"A\" finds himself being interrogated by an official dressed in turn-of-the-century clothing. \"A\" is now being addressed as if he were Yannakis Manakis. He is accused of sedition against the state of Bulgaria.. Although \"A\" protests that he does not understand, he is blindfolded and taken before a firing squad. At the last moment, a messenger arrives: King Ferdinand of Bulgaria has commuted Yannakis Manakis' sentence to exile until the war (The Balkan war of 1912-13) is over.\"A\" is reunited with Kali outside the contemporary police station. They board another train for Bucharest. As they step off the train, a young women (Mania Papadimitriou) in 1940's dress comes and addresses \"A\" as if he were a child. \"A,\" in turn, calls her \"Mother,\" and he apologizes for missing her funeral. Once more, we find ourselves in a time-warp, where \"A\" has returned to \"his\" childhood. They board a bus that takes them to their old home in Kostantza, on the Black Sea. They enter the house, where all of \"A's\" deceased \"relatives\" are dancing. He greets each one in turn, as a well-mannered child would. A man in rags appears in the room: it is his \"father\" returning from prison. The celebration of the father's return and of the New Year begins. We are in 1945, and there has been a temporary switch in the roles: \"A,\" as Telemachus, is greeting the return of his \"father,\" Ulysses. This is a familiar style that Angelopoulos has used in \"The Travelling Players,\" where this single scene, lasting some fifteen minutes in one continuous shot, covers five years as the characters waltz through the 1948 arrest of an uncle, to the 1950 New Year's Eve celebration, when the family is finally allowed to return to Greece. Through this scene, we now understand that \"A's\" memory has now merged with that of the Manakis' brothers.\"A\" awakens in a contemporary hotel in Kostantza, with Kali at his side. They go to the harbor, where a huge statue of Lenin is being loaded on a barge, in preparation for traveling up the Danube to Germany. A tearful \"A\" tells Kali, \"I cannot love you,\" just as Homer's Ulysses tells Calypso upon leaving her. \"A\" climbs aboard the barge, leaving a bewildered Kali on the quay. As the barge proceeds up the Danube River, groups of people on the riverbank stand in awe, many crossing themselves. This long traveling shot, accompanied by ethereal music, reminds us of the taxi ride in Albania. Toward the end of this shot, Arvanitis' camera, as if looking into Lenin's soul, circles slowly around the broken head of the statue, as a meditation on a ruin of the past.Arriving in Belgrade, \"A\" is met by his old friend, Nikos (Giogos Michalakopoulos) who, paraphrasing Angelopoulos' favorite poet, George Seferis, greats him with, \"When God created the World, the first thing he made were journeys.\" To which \"A\" answers, \"and then came doubt and nostalgia.\" They go to an old people's home, where they meet with an old man who was once in charge of the Belgrade Film Archives. The old man says that the Menakis' films are now with one of his friends at the Sarajevo Film Archives. Nikos and \"A\" end up in a café, drinking to the memories of old friends, and continue their voyage into nostalgia while drinking in the street. Obviously, Belgrade has become Ulysses' descent into Hades in the Odyssey, where he went to meet old friends and get instructions to complete his journey. \"A\" decides that despite the danger, he must go to Sarajevo. Nikos tells him to follow one of the many rivers which lead to it.Night time. \"A,\" asleep in an old shack, is being awakened by a young lady (Maia Morgenstern, yet again). They are in Philipoupolis, Bulgaria, and the year is 1915. Morgenstern now assumes the role of Homer's Circe, the sorceress. She leads \"A\" to the river, and they escape in a small boat. The next scene shows them on a bright morning, floating down the river. The couple eventually lands on the shore of a village in ruins, and they walk to a particular house, which used to be the woman's. The house, gutted by a conflagration, is in ruins. The woman, grief-stricken, desperately calls out, \"Vania!\" the name of her husband, who must have perished during the village's destruction. In the debris, \"A\" finds a picture frame with a turn-of-the-century wedding picture, which most likely is that of the woman and Vania. In a somewhat surrealist scene, a table with a white tablecloth has been set up in the midst of the rubble, and it is there in the evening where \"A\" and his companion have dinner. In the background, the rumble of guns and sharp explosions can be heard.When \"A\" wakes up, he is naked. He wraps himself in a blanket, walks outside, and sees the woman washing his clothes. She comes back to the house and gives him some of her husband's clothes. The woman goes to the river and demolishes the boat with an axe, obviously in order to hold \"A\" captive, as Circe also tried to do with Ulysses. She returns to the house, and seeing \"A\" dressed up in her husband's clothes, pulls him to the floor and makes passionate love to him.In the next scene, in the darkness, \"A\" has escaped Circe. He is drifting down the river in a small boat. At dawn, he arrives in Sarajevo. He eventually finds his way to the Film Archives, where he meets a young boy who takes him to an underground market to meet the Archives curator, a Jewish man by the name of Ivo Levy (Erland Josephson). They walk back to the gutted Film Archives building, each carrying containers of water. The siege of Sarajevo has been going on for some time, and the whole town is in ruins, its infrastructure destroyed. People risk their lives daily while fetching water at some of the still functioning water fountains, braving the bullets of Serbian snipers. Running back to the Film Archives, \"A\" explains to Levy the purpose of his coming to Sarajevo. Levy does have the three films and has tried repeatedly to find the correct chemical formula to develop them, but to no avail. . However, impressed by \"A's\" courage and determination, Levy says, \"You must have great faith, or is it despair?\" and agrees to try one more time.At the Film Archives, \"A\" goes to sleep and when he awakens, he meets a young woman, Levy's daughter, Noami ( Maia Morgenstern in her fourth role), a contemporary Nausicaa;. \"A\" is obviously struck by Noami's familiar face. By now, we understand that \"A\" has projected his past lovers in every woman he meets. Noami leaves, and \"A,\" looking around, sees that Levy has already started to get the lab working again. Later that night, Levy wakes up \"A\" and brings him to his lab where the development of a roll of film is in progress. At last, Levy is successful. \"A\" and the archivist are overwhelmed with joy and they embrace: after almost 100 years of being captive, an image of Greece from the turn of the century has at last been set free.The whole place is now flooded with fog. Levy explains that this is a welcome time for the inhabitants of Sarajevo: because of the fog, the Serbian snipers cannot operate, and the population is free to come outside their shelter and enjoy the open air. As \"A\" and Levy walk past a cemetery, we see some people taking advantage of the lull to bury their dead, Moslem and Orthodox Christians alike. The two friends come across an orchestra playing in a small square. Levy explains that it is made up of young Muslim, Croat, and Serb musicians. There is also a small production of \"Romeo and Juliet\" going on.Further on, some couples are dancing to a rock tune. Out of the fog, Naomi appears and invites \"A\" to dance. The music changes to a 1950s tune, and Naomi has now become the Penelope whom \"A\" had left behind in Florina, long time ago.Levy's family joins the trio and they walk together in the fog toward the river, with Levy and \"A\" straggling behind. Suddenly, there is a noise of a car stopping, doors slamming, and men's voices. Levy tells \"A\" to stay put and runs in the fog to rejoin the rest of the family. We hear Naomi's cry of, \"not the children!\" as gun shots are followed by splashes as bodies are dumped into the water. The car leaves and there is total, eerie silence. Throughout, we stare at the fog, only able to guess at the events that have just occurred. As always, Angelopoulos lets us contemplate the meaning of violence, rather than actually showing it. \"A\" runs to the spot of the massacre where he first finds Levy dead in the snow, and then Naomi. He embraces her, embracing at the same time all the women he has loved and lost. In helpless rage and anger, he releases several heart-wrenching screams. He returns slowly to the Film Archives, passing once more by the still-playing orchestra.The final scene shows a blank projection screen where a film has just been shown, most likely one of the Manakis' films. Then, a close-up shot of \"A,\" followed by a zoom backward, as he speaks Ulysses' lines to Penelope,\"When I return, it will be with another man's clothes\"\"A\" has reached his Ithaca, but his odyssey may not be over yet, as he is now looking toward another Ithaca.","description_full":"In \"Ulysses' Gaze\" (\"To Vlemma Tou Odyssea,\" 1995), a Greek-American filmmaker, not named in the film, and only referred to as \"A\" in the script, is on a quest to find three lost reels of undeveloped film, the first ever produced in Greece, from around 1905. These films are in fact the first cinematographic record, the first \"gaze\" in the philosophical sense, into the soul of the region. As the title implies, the story will take the form of an odyssey that begins in Greece and continues through Albania (the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, known to the Greeks as the Republic of Skopje), Bulgaria, Rumania, Serbia, and finally Bosnia.The film opens with an old black and white silent film that shows some village women weaving. In a voice-over, Harvey Keitel comments, \"Weavers in Avdella, a Greek Village, 1905, the first film made by the brothers Miltiades and Yannakis Manakis, [who filmed] all the ambiguities, the contrasts, the conflicts in this area of the world.\" For those of you who would watch \"Ulysses' Gaze\" only to find out if these three films ever existed, you now know the answer, and you don't have to watch to the end. But if you follow the advice of the Greek poet C. P. Cavafi, in his poem \"Ithaca\" (1911): \"When you start on your journey to Ithaca, / then pray that the road is long, / full of adventure, full of knowledge\", then you will enjoy the next 180 minutes of the journey.Following this antique piece of film showing the weaving village women, and before the opening titles, we see a small masterpiece of a scene, as only Angelopoulos can produce. An old man, standing on a quay, is getting his old-type camera ready to film a sailing ship coming out of the harbor of Salonika. The old man is Yannakis Manakis, and the scene, which took place in 1954, is recounted to \"A\" out of the camera's field of view by an old man who had been Manakis's assistant at that time. The assistant is not shown as he would have been at the time, but as he is today. While we watch Manakis finish preparing his camera and his assistant standing behind him recounting the event, the films takes on color. As the blue ship appears on the right side of the screen, Manakis is struck by a heart attack and collapses in a chair. The assistant walks toward the right of the screen, all the while continuing with his story. The camera scans to the right, and we discover \"A\" standing. \"A\" walks leftward, passing the point where we had just seen Manakis and his camera, but they are no longer there. We continue following \"A\" walking to the left, until the blue ship reappears in the field of view. The camera now follows the ship, slowly zooming in, until the ship stands still and fills the screen. Eventually, the camera stops tracking the ship and it disappears to the left. We are contemplating a blue-grey sea that dissolves into a sky of the same color. In his long shot, Angelopoulos has covered sixty years, and set the tone for the whole journey.As the film begins, \"A\" (Harvey Keitel) has arrived in a rainy Florina, a town in northern Greece, where one of his films is to be shown. The film is somehow controversial, and religious fanatics plan to demonstrate against its screening. One of the screening organizers advises \"A\" to leave town for his own safety. As \"A\" is about to enter a taxi, a woman (Maia Morgenstern) in her thirties passes him by and \"A,\" apparently stunned, follows her, muttering to himself: \"I did not expect you here.\" She disappears between the groups of demonstrators and counter-demonstrators who face each other. Morgenstern, who plays the roles of four different women in the film, is \"A's\" old love whom he left years ago, and therefore, a Penelope figure. The two groups rush toward each other, but the resulting confrontation is left unseen.Cut to a dreary winter day, with snow on the ground. \"A\" arrives at an Albanian border crossing in a taxi. While the taxi driver (Thanassis Vengos) tends to the police formalities, \"A\" notices an older lady (Dora Volanaki) with a suitcase standing nearby. \"A\" walks toward her, and she asks if he could give her a lift to a town over the border. She plans to visit her sister, whom she has not seen for forty-five years. \"A\" agrees and helps her into the taxi. Just then, a group of people arrives in a bus: they are illegal Albanian immigrants who were rounded up by the Greek police and are being return to their home country. As \"A's\" taxi proceeds across the Albanian side of the border, we see all along the road, in a desolate and gloomy snowy landscape, hundreds of Albanians standing like statues, waiting for a chance to sneak into Greece. The taxi reaches the town of Korytsa, stops in the middle of an empty square, and \"A\" helps the lady out. The taxi leaves, and a tracking-back long shot reveals the isolation and desolation of the town.The taxi continues toward the Macedonian border, but it has to stop because of snow on the road. The friendly taxi driver sensibly decides against a perilous crossing, and settles down, waiting for the snow to be cleared. He engages \"A\" in a conversation while listening to Greek music and drinking. He says, \"Greece is dying.We are dying as a people,\" reflecting on the present situation of Greece and its people.\"A\" arrives, apparently on a bus in Monastiri, in the Republic of Skopje.

She will now share \"A's\" journey.The train pulls in the station at the border. \"A\" and Kali are asked to step down -- apparently, there is something wrong with \"A's\" passport. Past and present mix once more: the train station alters and \"A\" finds himself being interrogated by an official dressed in turn-of-the-century clothing. \"A\" is now being addressed as if he were Yannakis Manakis. He is accused of sedition against the state of Bulgaria.. Although \"A\" protests that he does not understand, he is blindfolded and taken before a firing squad. At the last moment, a messenger arrives: King Ferdinand of Bulgaria has commuted Yannakis Manakis' sentence to exile until the war (The Balkan war of 1912-13) is over.\"A\" is reunited with Kali outside the contemporary police station. They board another train for Bucharest. As they step off the train, a young women (Mania Papadimitriou) in 1940's dress comes and addresses \"A\" as if he were a child. \"A,\" in turn, calls her \"Mother,\" and he apologizes for missing her funeral. Once more, we find ourselves in a time-warp, where \"A\" has returned to \"his\" childhood. They board a bus that takes them to their old home in Kostantza, on the Black Sea. They enter the house, where all of \"A's\" deceased \"relatives\" are dancing. He greets each one in turn, as a well-mannered child would. A man in rags appears in the room: it is his \"father\" returning from prison. The celebration of the father's return and of the New Year begins. We are in 1945, and there has been a temporary switch in the roles: \"A,\" as Telemachus, is greeting the return of his \"father,\" Ulysses. This is a familiar style that Angelopoulos has used in \"The Travelling Players,\" where this single scene, lasting some fifteen minutes in one continuous shot, covers five years as the characters waltz through the 1948 arrest of an uncle, to the 1950 New Year's Eve celebration, when the family is finally allowed to return to Greece. Through this scene, we now understand that \"A's\" memory has now merged with that of the Manakis' brothers.\"A\" awakens in a contemporary hotel in Kostantza, with Kali at his side. They go to the harbor, where a huge statue of Lenin is being loaded on a barge, in preparation for traveling up the Danube to Germany. A tearful \"A\" tells Kali, \"I cannot love you,\" just as Homer's Ulysses tells Calypso upon leaving her. \"A\" climbs aboard the barge, leaving a bewildered Kali on the quay. As the barge proceeds up the Danube River, groups of people on the riverbank stand in awe, many crossing themselves. This long traveling shot, accompanied by ethereal music, reminds us of the taxi ride in Albania. Toward the end of this shot, Arvanitis' camera, as if looking into Lenin's soul, circles slowly around the broken head of the statue, as a meditation on a ruin of the past.Arriving in Belgrade, \"A\" is met by his old friend, Nikos (Giogos Michalakopoulos) who, paraphrasing Angelopoulos' favorite poet, George Seferis, greats him with, \"When God created the World, the first thing he made were journeys.\" To which \"A\" answers, \"and then came doubt and nostalgia.\" They go to an old people's home, where they meet with an old man who was once in charge of the Belgrade Film Archives. The old man says that the Menakis' films are now with one of his friends at the Sarajevo Film Archives. Nikos and \"A\" end up in a café, drinking to the memories of old friends, and continue their voyage into nostalgia while drinking in the street. Obviously, Belgrade has become Ulysses' descent into Hades in the Odyssey, where he went to meet old friends and get instructions to complete his journey. \"A\" decides that despite the danger, he must go to Sarajevo. Nikos tells him to follow one of the many rivers which lead to it.Night time. \"A,\" asleep in an old shack, is being awakened by a young lady (Maia Morgenstern, yet again). They are in Philipoupolis, Bulgaria, and the year is 1915. Morgenstern now assumes the role of Homer's Circe, the sorceress. She leads \"A\" to the river, and they escape in a small boat. The next scene shows them on a bright morning, floating down the river. The couple eventually lands on the shore of a village in ruins, and they walk to a particular house, which used to be the woman's. The house, gutted by a conflagration, is in ruins. The woman, grief-stricken, desperately calls out, \"Vania!\" the name of her husband, who must have perished during the village's destruction. In the debris, \"A\" finds a picture frame with a turn-of-the-century wedding picture, which most likely is that of the woman and Vania. In a somewhat surrealist scene, a table with a white tablecloth has been set up in the midst of the rubble, and it is there in the evening where \"A\" and his companion have dinner. In the background, the rumble of guns and sharp explosions can be heard.When \"A\" wakes up, he is naked. He wraps himself in a blanket, walks outside, and sees the woman washing his clothes. She comes back to the house and gives him some of her husband's clothes. The woman goes to the river and demolishes the boat with an axe, obviously in order to hold \"A\" captive, as Circe also tried to do with Ulysses. She returns to the house, and seeing \"A\" dressed up in her husband's clothes, pulls him to the floor and makes passionate love to him.In the next scene, in the darkness, \"A\" has escaped Circe. He is drifting down the river in a small boat. At dawn, he arrives in Sarajevo. He eventually finds his way to the Film Archives, where he meets a young boy who takes him to an underground market to meet the Archives curator, a Jewish man by the name of Ivo Levy (Erland Josephson). They walk back to the gutted Film Archives building, each carrying containers of water. The siege of Sarajevo has been going on for some time, and the whole town is in ruins, its infrastructure destroyed. People risk their lives daily while fetching water at some of the still functioning water fountains, braving the bullets of Serbian snipers. Running back to the Film Archives, \"A\" explains to Levy the purpose of his coming to Sarajevo. Levy does have the three films and has tried repeatedly to find the correct chemical formula to develop them, but to no avail. . However, impressed by \"A's\" courage and determination, Levy says, \"You must have great faith, or is it despair?\" and agrees to try one more time.At the Film Archives, \"A\" goes to sleep and when he awakens, he meets a young woman, Levy's daughter, Noami ( Maia Morgenstern in her fourth role), a contemporary Nausicaa;. \"A\" is obviously struck by Noami's familiar face. By now, we understand that \"A\" has projected his past lovers in every woman he meets. Noami leaves, and \"A,\" looking around, sees that Levy has already started to get the lab working again. Later that night, Levy wakes up \"A\" and brings him to his lab where the development of a roll of film is in progress. At last, Levy is successful. \"A\" and the archivist are overwhelmed with joy and they embrace: after almost 100 years of being captive, an image of Greece from the turn of the century has at last been set free.The whole place is now flooded with fog. Levy explains that this is a welcome time for the inhabitants of Sarajevo: because of the fog, the Serbian snipers cannot operate, and the population is free to come outside their shelter and enjoy the open air. As \"A\" and Levy walk past a cemetery, we see some people taking advantage of the lull to bury their dead, Moslem and Orthodox Christians alike. The two friends come across an orchestra playing in a small square. Levy explains that it is made up of young Muslim, Croat, and Serb musicians. There is also a small production of \"Romeo and Juliet\" going on.Further on, some couples are dancing to a rock tune. Out of the fog, Naomi appears and invites \"A\" to dance. The music changes to a 1950s tune, and Naomi has now become the Penelope whom \"A\" had left behind in Florina, long time ago.Levy's family joins the trio and they walk together in the fog toward the river, with Levy and \"A\" straggling behind. Suddenly, there is a noise of a car stopping, doors slamming, and men's voices. Levy tells \"A\" to stay put and runs in the fog to rejoin the rest of the family. We hear Naomi's cry of, \"not the children!\" as gun shots are followed by splashes as bodies are dumped into the water. The car leaves and there is total, eerie silence. Throughout, we stare at the fog, only able to guess at the events that have just occurred. As always, Angelopoulos lets us contemplate the meaning of violence, rather than actually showing it. \"A\" runs to the spot of the massacre where he first finds Levy dead in the snow, and then Naomi. He embraces her, embracing at the same time all the women he has loved and lost. In helpless rage and anger, he releases several heart-wrenching screams. He returns slowly to the Film Archives, passing once more by the still-playing orchestra.The final scene shows a blank projection screen where a film has just been shown, most likely one of the Manakis' films. Then, a close-up shot of \"A,\" followed by a zoom backward, as he speaks Ulysses' lines to Penelope,\"When I return, it will be with another man's clothes\"\"A\" has reached his Ithaca, but his odyssey may not be over yet, as he is now looking toward another Ithaca.","yt_trailer_code":"8VF48LWXCjU","language":"el","mpa_rating":"","background_image":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/ulysses_gaze_1995/background.jpg","background_image_original":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/ulysses_gaze_1995/background.jpg","small_cover_image":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/ulysses_gaze_1995/small-cover.jpg","medium_cover_image":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/ulysses_gaze_1995/medium-cover.jpg","large_cover_image":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/ulysses_gaze_1995/large-cover.jpg","state":"ok","torrents":[{"url":"https://yts.mx/torrent/download/051F112C8883A0D60DDF6D9CBD7BA2DFF4E93E81","hash":"051F112C8883A0D60DDF6D9CBD7BA2DFF4E93E81","quality":"480p","type":"bluray","is_repack":"0","video_codec":"x264","bit_depth":"8","audio_channels":"2.0","seeds":77,"peers":26,"size":"1.46 GB","size_bytes":1567663063,"date_uploaded":"2023-10-20 19:51:42","date_uploaded_unix":1697824302}]},{"id":56674,"url":"https://yts.mx/movies/the-other-zoey-2023","imdb_code":"tt11951276","title":"The Other Zoey","title_english":"The Other Zoey","title_long":"The Other Zoey (2023)","slug":"the-other-zoey-2023","year":2023,"rating":6,"runtime":91,"genres":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"summary":"Zoey Miller (Josephine Langford), a super smart college student who is uninterested in romantic love, has her life turned upside down when Zach (Drew Starkey), the captain of the boys' soccer team, gets amnesia and mistakes Zoey for his girlfriend.

sergeant in the Korean War, has recently been discharged and is in Las Vegas to visit an old army buddy. In a bar, Jim carelessly insults Terry Flynn, a blowzy, blonde gold digger and former fashion model, and she picks a fight with him, but they end up embracing. The next morning, while hitching a ride, Jim is picked up by the Las Vegas police and taken to an apartment where Lt. Joe White Eagle shows him Flynn's dead body. As Jim was seen fighting with Flynn, White Eagle suspects that he may have strangled her. After Jim says that he was with his army buddy, Paul, who can verify his alibi, he realizes that the soldier was on a classified security mission and therefore was not registered at his hotel under his real name. Despite Jim's excellent Marine record, White Eagle feels that he has enough evidence against him to hold him. However, Jim resists arrest and seizes one of the police officer's revolver, holds the police officers at bay and escapes in one of their patrol cars, shooting out the tires on the other.. Driving down Highway 91, Jim turns off the road, abandons the car, changes his clothes and walks back to where he has spotted top magazine photographer Mrs. H. G. Cummings and her model Susan trying to start their disabled car. After Jim fixes the car, the ladies offer him a ride. However, before they can continue, Mrs. Cummings' small dog runs into the road because she has lost the leash and is killed by a passing car. When they reach the Apple Valley Inn where they have a photographic assignment, Mrs. Cummings and Susan invite Jim to spend some time with them. After the abandoned patrol car is found, White Eagle decides to pursue Jim into California and orders roadblocks set up. At the inn, when a newspaper with a report of the murder and Jim's photo is delivered to Susan and Mrs. Cummings' room, Susan wants to call the police, but Mrs. Cummings points out that the murdered woman was the tramp her husband Harold killed himself over and therefore they might suspect her of the murder. Later, after the inn's publicity is tipped by Mrs. Cummings that Jim is the wanted killer he alerts the police. Jim takes Mrs. Cummings and Susan hostage, steals a car and crashes through a roadblock. With White Eagle and other units in pursuit, Jim manages to lose them by leaving the highway and driving across the desert. However, the car becomes stuck in sand and when Jim attempts to free it, Mrs. Cummings grabs his gun and is about to shoot him when Susan wrestles the weapon away from her, as Susan now believes that Jim may be innocent. Later, Jim tells Susan that he is scheduled to meet Paul, who can confirm his alibi, the next morning at Jim's partially flooded house at the Salton Sea. When Jim, Mrs. Cummings and Susan reach the house, Jim gets out and tells them to leave, but Susan decides to stay with Jim as she has fallen in love with him. In the house, Jim finds a note from Paul stating that he had to leave on another assignment for the army, thereby depriving Jim of his alibi. Suddenly, White Eagle, who has tracked Jim there, appears, tells Jim that he is under arrest and orders him to put his gun down. Mrs. Cummings enters silently, picks up the gun and, as Susan is about to tell White Eagle about Flynn and Harold, shoots the lieutenant. She then tries to shoot Jim and Susan, but the gun malfunctions and she runs away and falls into what she believes is quicksand. She begs Jim to rescue her, but before doing so, he extracts a confession from her that she strangled Flynn with her dog's leash. Jim then tells her that she was in no danger as there is no quicksand on his property.The police have overheard her confession and a wounded White Eagle orders that all charges against Jim be dropped.

Horse races. Claire continues to manipulate the emotions of Les to keep him helping her. When Blackie comes back into her life for blackmailing purposes, Claire dispatches him and cuddles up to successful politician Stanley Mason (James Whalen) for a ride to the top of the heap. Mason is running for Congress, and we hear him ordering lots of fancy drinks. When he discovers her getting close to Les, Mason confronts Claire, and the wedding is off. When Les discovers the depths of Claire's ruthlessness, he realizes it may cost him his own life. Later, Claire meets Dr. Klippinger, who psycho-analyzes her; there's a showdown. Claire is furious and tries to shoot Klippinger, but (SPOILERS) Claire offs herself with the gun.","yt_trailer_code":"JksMV-dqs7g","language":"en","mpa_rating":"","background_image":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/blonde_ice_1948/background.jpg","background_image_original":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/blonde_ice_1948/background.jpg","small_cover_image":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/blonde_ice_1948/small-cover.jpg","medium_cover_image":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/blonde_ice_1948/medium-cover.jpg","large_cover_image":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/blonde_ice_1948/large-cover.jpg","state":"ok","torrents":[{"url":"https://yts.mx/torrent/download/14C996801CB0160FF601B390E132952E2DECECA3","hash":"14C996801CB0160FF601B390E132952E2DECECA3","quality":"720p","type":"bluray","is_repack":"0","video_codec":"x264","bit_depth":"8","audio_channels":"2.0","seeds":7,"peers":0,"size":"683.44 MB","size_bytes":716638781,"date_uploaded":"2023-07-24 10:32:12","date_uploaded_unix":1690187532},{"url":"https://yts.mx/torrent/download/C1E2124B893C6DCC886F5C027B6A330D2FE69B9F","hash":"C1E2124B893C6DCC886F5C027B6A330D2FE69B9F","quality":"1080p","type":"bluray","is_repack":"0","video_codec":"x264","bit_depth":"8","audio_channels":"2.0","seeds":10,"peers":2,"size":"1.24 GB","size_bytes":1331439862,"date_uploaded":"2023-07-24 11:21:55","date_uploaded_unix":1690190515}],"date_uploaded":"2023-07-24 10:32:12","date_uploaded_unix":1690187532},{"id":53416,"url":"https://yts.mx/movies/beware-my-lovely-1952","imdb_code":"tt0044417","title":"Beware, My Lovely","title_english":"Beware, My Lovely","title_long":"Beware, My Lovely (1952)","slug":"beware-my-lovely-1952","year":1952,"rating":6.6,"runtime":77,"genres":["Crime","Drama","Film-Noir"],"summary":"Helen Gordon hires Howard Wilton as a handyman to do chores around her house.

He soon learns the academic challenge is formidable, many boys being still illiterate, but gradually earns their trust, respect, in time almost devotion, with 'paternal' kindness, making the layman the opposite of the cruel prefect, brother John, who frequently administers painful and humiliating punishments, even the gentle, old superior Father Damian has no authority against his disciplinary mandate from the grim bishop Conlon. Slowly even class rebel Liam Mercier is turned around, trough his gift for literature. After Franklin dares stop the sadist's penny-weighted strap severely striking 'sinful scum' for a futility, the whole dorm is treated to an icy night outdoors, arms outstretched wearing only shorts. Brother Mac's mind may mean to educate well, his flesh is too weak for celibacy, so the coy, pretty new boy becomes his latest pederastic lust-object, sworn to suffer sodomy in silence- even devoutly confessing to Father O'Driscoll his fear to have lost his innocence during painful rape costs him an endless cold shower, shivering stark-naked before his tormentor.

Tracy asks if Jack has a dance partner for the Romeo and Juliet performance. Jack is obviously gay, but Tracy doesnt pick up on it. The acting professor comes in and starts asking the students what they are willing to do for art. Thomas launches into a streak of insulting Employee of the Month, while Megan defends the movie saying that she saw it four times. The teacher enjoys the debate and then points out that most actors are white and that what few roles are available are for the Wayans Brothers (a reference to the fact that they made the movie.) He tells the class that the one thing all actors have is dignity, and then establishes the fact that he sold out for money (which to him equals dignity).Megan goes to her dance lesson with her teacher Mrs. Cameltoe, who goes through them and starts insulting every student. One student commits suicide from the comments. Cameltoe wants them all to step up their game.Meanwhile, Jack is playing basketball with his dad.

Thomas and his partner run into the dance crew they lost to early. They trade insults before bouncing out of the club. Thomas leaves angry and Megan follows him wanting to find out more. He shrugs it off and Thomas offers to walk with Meganso she will protect him from thugs. He tells her he enjoyed the night and offers to work on dance moves with her.The next day they work on their dance moves. He tells her she needs to be more aggressive and then he ends up beating her brutally when she pushes him. She asks him about his partner, Akon.

Thomas then takes Megan out to celebrate. He takes her to a showing of MY MOM DIED IN A CAR CRASH a performance about Megans mom. Megan breaks down crying while Thomas laughs his ass off. Afterward, Megan expresses her desire to have her mom back and stopped dancing because of her. Thomas tells her that her moms death was her fault since she set ridiculous expectations. Thomas tells her that if she wants to get into Julliard she needs to move past the baggage. Theyre about to kiss when some black girls walk by and Thomas pretends not to know her.Thomas' boss sends thugs to collect Akon and Thomas. He tries to signal Megan to call the cops by telling her to call him at 9:11, that he bought Police concert tickets and that theres a marathon of COPS on television that she should look into. Shes oblivious so Thomas is taken to his presumed death. The boss is angry that Akon and Thomas dont have his money. He enters them into the next dance battle and tells them that they better win.Cut to basketball. The girls are playing basketball in the gym. Nora starts mocking Megan before showing that Thomas recorded them having sex (One Night in Megan) and started selling it. The two start fighting in the gym. Jacks dad is there whipping the mens wrestling team into shape and starts screaming at them with homosexual innuendos riddling the speech. Jack screams in support of it, and his Dad thinks its good team spirit and agrees with him. Charity says that Nora is just an oppressed white girl and Megan takes offense to that saying that she paid her dues. It shows Megan receiving a DUI and attempting to fellate an officer when he asks her to blow on the breathalyzer.Meanwhile, Akon hatches a plan to kill their boss in order to avoid paying back the debt. Thomas doesnt want to do it. During a dance session with Thomas, Megan dumps him because they spend more time defending their relationship than having one.

He then leaves.Thomas meets up with Akon and his friends and tells them that hes not going to participate in a drive by on their boss. Akon tells him that he cant go to J.C.C. like Thomas and tells him that his life is that of a gangster. They drive off to kill the boss, leaving Thomas alone.Megan hears about the fact that Thomas is 5,000 dollars in debt and starts to set up a crew to win the dance battle. Megan grabs Tracy, Nora and Jack to form a crew to win the contest money and leaves her own school showcase to help Thomas.Just as the winner is about to be announced by the judge, Thomas arrives and challenges the crew that beat him in the beginning. Megan arrives with her crew and the dance off begins. Akon arrives to back up Thomas telling him that someone else already took out their boss. The crews face off and pull off a well choreographed routine. Megan falls down and suffers with self doubt. She starts dancing like a stripper on a poll (including spinning around the poll with her teeth). Akon and Thomas start dancing with roller skates and shorts. Akon carries Thomas on his head and little disco balls come out of Thomass shorts. The Judge announces that the dance off is a tie. He gets pissed at the decision of the panel and tells the crew that each crew gets one dance move and that the audience will decide the winner. The other crew steals D performed before he died. Hope seems lost when Thomas and Akons fat boss arrives and starts dancing. He pulls off a killer fat man routine which impresses the judges panel and the audience. The boss crushes the leader of the other team, leaving him pressed into the floor and winning the competition.Megan and Thomas reconcile as Mrs. Cameltoe arrives.

As the opening credits scroll across the screen \"Hooray for Hollywood\" is played by an unseen orchestra. The song continues as the action begins. We see several signs: \"Clark Gable Beware!,\" then a trumpet player improvises; \"Kay Francis Here He Comes!,\" then a saxophone player plays; \"Leslie Howard Watch Your Step!,\" then a trombone player plays a lick; \"Garbo I Tank You Like Him!,\" then a string bass player slaps his bass; \"Olivia de Havilland Your Midsummer Nights Dream Is On His Way!,\" and then Benny Goodman (himself) improvises on his clarinet (all instrumentalists are members of Goodman's band). The camera reveals that each of these instrumentalists and many other members of the band are in a motorcade, with each person in a different car with a different sign plastered on the front of each car. They are parading, under police escort, to the St. Louis Airport. Once they arrive, they continue the song with Georgia (Johnnie Scat Davis) and Alice (Frances Langford) singing the lyrics; then, the band members also sing. The band is seeing one of its saxophone players, Ronnie Bowers (Dick Powell), off to Hollywood; he has signed a ten-week movie contract with Miracle Pictures; the studio's motto is: \"Miracle Pictures Studio, If Its a Good Picture, Its a Miracle.\" As his plane taxies away from the loading area, the band launches into \"California, Here I Come.\"\nThe next sequence is a montage of various Hollywood sights as \"Hooray for Hollywood\" plays in the background. Ronnie is met at the airport by Bernie Walton (Allyn Joslyn) from the Miracle Pictures publicity department. The studio photographer takes a couple of shots of his arrival, after which he is escorted to the Hollywood Hotel, where he'll be staying.\nThe scene switches to the hotel suite of film star Mona Marshall (Lola Lane) where the famous gossip columnist, Louella Parsons (herself), is interviewing Miss Marshall while she is being fitted with a gown to wear to the premier of her newest film. Mona is ranting and raving and thoroughly overacting about everything. She is the prototypical spoiled, self-absorbed female movie star. When she learns that someone else has been cast in the lead role of a film she had coveted, she refuses to appear at the premier of her film that evening. Instead, she and her assistant leave town.\nThe studio head is in a panic when he learns the star of his film will not appear at the premier. The studio publicity man, Bernie, comes up with a solution. Hell find a double to stand-in for Mona. After Bernie auditions several women, he chooses Virginia Stanton (Rosemary Lane) as Monas substitute (Rosemary and Lola Lane are sisters, so there is a definite resemblance). To escort her to the premier, he selects Ronnie Bowers, the new guy the studio has signed to a short term contract.\nBernie and the studios make-up crew take Virginia to Monas Hollywood Hotel penthouse suite and transform her into a Mona look-a-like. Ronnie is thrilled that his first night in Hollywood he will be escorting the famous Mona Marshall to her film premier. When he gets to the penthouse, a call comes from the front desk that Alexander DuPrey (Alan Mowbray), Mona's co-star in \"Glamour Girl,\" is coming up to escort her to the premier. Bernie has told the maid not allow anyone except Ronnie into Monas suite. When she hears that DuPrey is coming up, she panics. Ronnie, however, rescues the situation by socking DuPrey to keep him out of Monas suite.\nAt the premier at Cathay Circle, the announcer interviewing the stars as they arrive is future President of the United States, a very young Ronald Reagan.\nAfter the premier, Ronnie and Mona/Virginia return to the Hollywood Hotel's Orchid Room for a party. As they dance together, she tells him shes tired of all the photographs and autograph seekers, so they walk out into a garden area where they sit by a fountain pool. As she dunks her toes into the cool water, he sings \"I'm Like a Fish Out of Water.\" After he sings a chorus, she sings as they dance together in the fountain. During this number, Monas sister, Dot (Mabel Todd), chases Fuzzy (Ted Healy), who is trying to avoid her, into the garden where they sing a chorus of the song. Ronnie and Mona/Virginia hide when they see Dot and Fuzzy coming (Virginia is certain Dot will realize that she isnt Mona) and turn on the fountain which soaks both of them. As the song concludes, Ronnie and Mona/Virginia kiss.\nWhen Mona reads the morning paper and sees a photo of Virginia posing as her at the premier, she explodes. She rushes to the studio and demands they fire both Virginia and Ronnie. When Ronnie arrives for his appointment with the head of the studio, Mona storms out of the office and slaps him when he calls her darling. Bernie informs Ronnie that the studio head has fired him. Completely confused, Ronnie goes with Bernie to a coffee shop where Virginia is the waitress, which confuses Ronnie even more. Before anyone can explain, he stalks out of the coffee shop. When he encounters Mona as she is leaving the hotel, she slaps him again. Finally, Bernie explains to Ronnie that it was Virginia he escorted to the premier. Ronnie and Virginia are out on a sightseeing date when they climb over a hill to the Hollywood Bowl. To illustrate the Bowl's exceptional acoustics, Virginia sings \"Silhouetted in the Moonlight\" from the stage while Ronnie remains on the hill.\nAfter being summarily fired, Ronnie acquires Fuzzy as his manager. Ronnie and Fuzzy see Benny Goodman, Alice and Georgia on a Hollywood street corner and learn that the band has been booked at the Hollywood Hotel.\nRonnie and Fuzzy find work as waiters at Callaghan's, a drive-in restaurant. Virginia comes by the drive-in and agrees to wait for Ronnie until he gets off.\nThe scene switches to the Orchid Room where Benny Goodman introduces the song, \"Let That Be a Lesson to You.\" Georgia sings the lyrics, but suddenly the scene switches back to the drive-in where Ronnie sings a lyric about himself as he serves Virginia a milk shake. Later, Virginia and most of the drive-ins customers also join in the song. Dot, who also shows up at the drive-in, sings a chorus to Fuzzy.\nA director from Miracle Studio happens to be a customer at Callaghan's and hears the performance. He tells Ronnie he wants to hire him. Virginia tries to talk Ronnie and Fuzzy out of quitting their waiting jobs, but they wont listen.\nWhen Ronnie and Fuzzy arrive at the film location the next day, they discover that the director wants Ronnie to dub the singing voice of Alexander DuPrey.\nIn a rehearsal sequence, Benny Goodman and His Orchestra play \"Sing, Sing, Sing,\" which features Gene Krupa's marvelous extended drum solo and solos by Harry James on trumpet and Benny Goodman on clarinet. Then, Goodman's quartet (Lionel Hampton on vibes, Teddy Wilson on piano, Gene Krupa on drums and Goodman on clarinet) plays \"I've Got a Heartful of Music.\" At the preview screening of Mona Marshall and Alexander DuPrey's film \"Love & Glory,\" Ronnie sings \"I've Hitched My Wagon to a Star\" as DuPrey mouths the lyrics on screen. Even though Ronnie's voice doesn't fit DuPrey, everyone is impressed with DuPrey's vocal abilities. Louella Parsons asks him to sing on her radio show. He accepts, but later panics when Mona asks whose voice he will use. Ronnie has disappeared and the studio cant locate him. They call Virginia for help and she finds him working as a waiter at Callaghan's drive-in again. Ronnie, however, doesn't want to dub for DuPrey any more. If he sings, he says, he wants it to be his face on the screen.\nVirginia cooks up an idea. Again posing as Mona, Virginia picks up DuPrey to accompany him to Louella's radio program.

After Bernie auditions several women, he chooses Virginia Stanton (Rosemary Lane) as Monas substitute (Rosemary and Lola Lane are sisters, so there is a definite resemblance). To escort her to the premier, he selects Ronnie Bowers, the new guy the studio has signed to a short term contract.\nBernie and the studios make-up crew take Virginia to Monas Hollywood Hotel penthouse suite and transform her into a Mona look-a-like. Ronnie is thrilled that his first night in Hollywood he will be escorting the famous Mona Marshall to her film premier. When he gets to the penthouse, a call comes from the front desk that Alexander DuPrey (Alan Mowbray), Mona's co-star in \"Glamour Girl,\" is coming up to escort her to the premier. Bernie has told the maid not allow anyone except Ronnie into Monas suite. When she hears that DuPrey is coming up, she panics. Ronnie, however, rescues the situation by socking DuPrey to keep him out of Monas suite.\nAt the premier at Cathay Circle, the announcer interviewing the stars as they arrive is future President of the United States, a very young Ronald Reagan.\nAfter the premier, Ronnie and Mona/Virginia return to the Hollywood Hotel's Orchid Room for a party. As they dance together, she tells him shes tired of all the photographs and autograph seekers, so they walk out into a garden area where they sit by a fountain pool. As she dunks her toes into the cool water, he sings \"I'm Like a Fish Out of Water.\" After he sings a chorus, she sings as they dance together in the fountain. During this number, Monas sister, Dot (Mabel Todd), chases Fuzzy (Ted Healy), who is trying to avoid her, into the garden where they sing a chorus of the song. Ronnie and Mona/Virginia hide when they see Dot and Fuzzy coming (Virginia is certain Dot will realize that she isnt Mona) and turn on the fountain which soaks both of them. As the song concludes, Ronnie and Mona/Virginia kiss.\nWhen Mona reads the morning paper and sees a photo of Virginia posing as her at the premier, she explodes. She rushes to the studio and demands they fire both Virginia and Ronnie. When Ronnie arrives for his appointment with the head of the studio, Mona storms out of the office and slaps him when he calls her darling. Bernie informs Ronnie that the studio head has fired him. Completely confused, Ronnie goes with Bernie to a coffee shop where Virginia is the waitress, which confuses Ronnie even more. Before anyone can explain, he stalks out of the coffee shop. When he encounters Mona as she is leaving the hotel, she slaps him again. Finally, Bernie explains to Ronnie that it was Virginia he escorted to the premier. Ronnie and Virginia are out on a sightseeing date when they climb over a hill to the Hollywood Bowl. To illustrate the Bowl's exceptional acoustics, Virginia sings \"Silhouetted in the Moonlight\" from the stage while Ronnie remains on the hill.\nAfter being summarily fired, Ronnie acquires Fuzzy as his manager. Ronnie and Fuzzy see Benny Goodman, Alice and Georgia on a Hollywood street corner and learn that the band has been booked at the Hollywood Hotel.\nRonnie and Fuzzy find work as waiters at Callaghan's, a drive-in restaurant. Virginia comes by the drive-in and agrees to wait for Ronnie until he gets off.\nThe scene switches to the Orchid Room where Benny Goodman introduces the song, \"Let That Be a Lesson to You.\" Georgia sings the lyrics, but suddenly the scene switches back to the drive-in where Ronnie sings a lyric about himself as he serves Virginia a milk shake. Later, Virginia and most of the drive-ins customers also join in the song. Dot, who also shows up at the drive-in, sings a chorus to Fuzzy.\nA director from Miracle Studio happens to be a customer at Callaghan's and hears the performance. He tells Ronnie he wants to hire him. Virginia tries to talk Ronnie and Fuzzy out of quitting their waiting jobs, but they wont listen.\nWhen Ronnie and Fuzzy arrive at the film location the next day, they discover that the director wants Ronnie to dub the singing voice of Alexander DuPrey.\nIn a rehearsal sequence, Benny Goodman and His Orchestra play \"Sing, Sing, Sing,\" which features Gene Krupa's marvelous extended drum solo and solos by Harry James on trumpet and Benny Goodman on clarinet. Then, Goodman's quartet (Lionel Hampton on vibes, Teddy Wilson on piano, Gene Krupa on drums and Goodman on clarinet) plays \"I've Got a Heartful of Music.\" At the preview screening of Mona Marshall and Alexander DuPrey's film \"Love & Glory,\" Ronnie sings \"I've Hitched My Wagon to a Star\" as DuPrey mouths the lyrics on screen. Even though Ronnie's voice doesn't fit DuPrey, everyone is impressed with DuPrey's vocal abilities. Louella Parsons asks him to sing on her radio show. He accepts, but later panics when Mona asks whose voice he will use. Ronnie has disappeared and the studio cant locate him. They call Virginia for help and she finds him working as a waiter at Callaghan's drive-in again. Ronnie, however, doesn't want to dub for DuPrey any more. If he sings, he says, he wants it to be his face on the screen.\nVirginia cooks up an idea. Again posing as Mona, Virginia picks up DuPrey to accompany him to Louella's radio program. Fuzzy is the chauffeur and Mona's father, Chester (Hugh Herbert), is also along to help. They drive until DuPrey demands he be let out of the car. They gladly let him out, but by then, it is too late for him to make the radio show.\nThe CBS broadcast begins with Raymond Paige and His Orchestra (themselves) performing a reprise of \"Silhouetted in the Moonlight.\" Jerry Cooper, Paige's male vocalist, and Alice are the vocal soloists. Next, Paige, his instrumentalists and a chorus perform \"Dark Eyes\" in their jazz symphonique style. Then, Louella Parsons introduces Ronnie and Mona to perform a scene from \"Love & Glory.\" During this sequence, Ronnie reprises \"I've Hitched My Wagon to a Star.\"\nEverybody (Ronnie, Virginia, Georgia, Alice, Mona, Jerry, Dot, Fuzzy, and the chorus) gets involved in the finale, \"Sing, You Son of a Gun,\" which evolves into a final reprise of \"Hooray for Hollywood.\"","yt_trailer_code":"","language":"en","mpa_rating":"","background_image":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/hollywood_hotel_1937/background.jpg","background_image_original":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/hollywood_hotel_1937/background.jpg","small_cover_image":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/hollywood_hotel_1937/small-cover.jpg","medium_cover_image":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/hollywood_hotel_1937/medium-cover.jpg","large_cover_image":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/hollywood_hotel_1937/large-cover.jpg","state":"ok","torrents":[{"url":"https://yts.mx/torrent/download/93CD3695D0D638066F5F1195724A7A59D4564C62","hash":"93CD3695D0D638066F5F1195724A7A59D4564C62","quality":"720p","type":"web","is_repack":"0","video_codec":"x264","bit_depth":"8","audio_channels":"2.0","seeds":28,"peers":4,"size":"1006.33 MB","size_bytes":1055213486,"date_uploaded":"2023-10-19 01:41:40","date_uploaded_unix":1697672500},{"url":"https://yts.mx/torrent/download/CA0AF7BAAB3B889C1EAD5A5098374814CF84022E","hash":"CA0AF7BAAB3B889C1EAD5A5098374814CF84022E","quality":"1080p","type":"web","is_repack":"0","video_codec":"x264","bit_depth":"8","audio_channels":"2.0","seeds":59,"peers":11,"size":"1.82 GB","size_bytes":1954210120,"date_uploaded":"2023-10-19 02:48:26","date_uploaded_unix":1697676506}],"date_uploaded":"2023-10-19 01:41:40","date_uploaded_unix":1697672500},{"id":56636,"url":"https://yts.mx/movies/joseph-and-the-amazing-technicolor-dreamcoat-1999","imdb_code":"tt0175790","title":"Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat","title_english":"Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat","title_long":"Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat (1999)","slug":"joseph-and-the-amazing-technicolor-dreamcoat-1999","year":1999,"rating":7.3,"runtime":76,"genres":["Musical"],"summary":"In this filmed adaption of the long-running musical, we see the story of Joseph (Donny Osmond), son of Jacob (Sir Richard Attenborough).

Young Judy Standish (Maureen O'Sullivan) inherited the family business, along with its debts and mortgages, and is determined to keep going despite the fact that local businessman J.D. Morgan (Douglass Dumbrille) is pressuring her to sell out. Morgan needs the sanitarium property in order to expand his racetrack and resort hotel empire, and is conniving to have the sanitarium fail, aided by Judy's oily business manager, Whitmore (Leonard Ceeley), who is secretly in cahoots with Morgan.Judy's last hope is to request financial assistance from her most well-heeled client, the wealthy widow (and hypochondriac) Mrs. Emily Upjohn (Margaret Dumont). To Judy's dismay, Mrs. Upjohn storms into the lobby and announces that she is leaving. The incompetent medical staff has had the nerve to tell her there is nothing wrong with her. Mrs. Upjohn yearns for the ministrations of Dr. Hugo Z. Hackenbush, since \"I never knew a thing was wrong with me before I met him.\" Overhearing this exchange, Judy's loyal man-of-all-work Tony (Chico Marx) announces that Dr. Hackenbush will soon be arriving. He then rushes off to telegraph Hackenbush offering him a job. As Tony observes, \"If she want a hack-in-de-puss, she gonna get a hack-in-de-puss.\"Judy's fiancé Gil Stewart (Allan Jones) is hoping to make it as a singer, but in the meantime has come up with a quicker plan to earn enough to save the sanitarium and marry Judy. He has sunk all his savings into purchasing a race horse called Hi Hat, to be ridden by an eccentric local mute jockey named Stuffy (Harpo Marx). A couple of realities intrude on Gil's plan. Hi Hat's practice times are mediocre, and Gil has no money to keep up with the horse's expenses, causing the local sheriff (Robert Middlemass) to come after the horse to repossess it for the unpaid feed bill. Fortunately, some sleight-of-hand by Tony and Stuffy keeps the sheriff at bay for the time being. Gil is also dismayed that he has a sure thing tip for a race that afternoon, but no money to bet. Tony reassures him that he will get some money by finding a sucker.In Florida, Dr. Hugo Z. Hackenbush (Groucho Marx) is treating one of his clients, a horse, when the telegram arrives with the job offer. Aware that they can put a veterinarian in jail for treating people, he observes that he can also be put in jail for not paying his rent and has nothing to lose. Soon he arrives at Standish Sanitarium, where Judy appoints him chief of staff at the behest of Mrs. Upjohn, who has agreed to pay Hackenbush's salary and has hinted that she may help the sanitarium financially. The rest of the medical staff, and the scheming business manager Whitmore, are suspicious of Hackenbush's credentials, but he manages to double talk his way around them, and then, at the sound of the bugle call, heads for the racetrack. On his way to place a bet on Sunup, Hackenbush encounters Tony in the guise of an ice cream vendor. Tony offers a hot tip, which turns out to be in code, which a variety of code books and reference works are needed to interpret. After spending a wad of cash on useless books, Hackenbush winds up with a losing horse while Tony bets the profits on the winner - Sunup!Whitmore attempts to verify Hackenbush's credentials with the Florida Medical Board, but Hackenbush manages to divert the calls, to Whitmore's frustration. In order to keep an eye on Whitmore, Tony brings Stuffy into the sanitarium for treatment. During Hackenbush's examination of Stuffy, Tony discovers that Hackenbush is really a horse doctor. Hackenbush wants to flee, but Tony insists that he stay to try to help Judy. At the water carnival, where Gil is the featured vocalist, Hackenbush escorts Mrs. Upjohn but is distracted by a voluptuous blonde named Flo (Esther Muir), with whom he performs an energetic rumba and arranges a late-night rendezvous. Tony and Stuffy invade the bandstand and treat the audience to a comic musical performance. Afterwards, Stuffy overhears that Flo has been hired by Whitmore to lure Hackenbush into a compromising situation. He manages to convey this information to Tony, and the two rush to the rescue. Flo arrives at Hackenbush's suite at the sanitarium for a late night supper. Hackenbush tries to romance Flo, but Tony and Stuffy keep interrupting, first as house detectives, then as decorators hanging wallpaper. At the crucial moment, Whitmore leads the indignant Mrs. Upjohn to Hackenbush's suite, but Flo is safely hidden inside the sofa under a pile of wallpaper, and Mrs. Upjohn redirects her anger to Whitmore.Stuffy hides the horse in a room in the sanitarium. In a further attempt to discredit Hackenbush, Whitmore has brought in Dr. Steinberg (Sig Ruman), a pointy-bearded Austrian physician, to examine Mrs. Upjohn. Steinberg declares that he has never met a healthier woman in his life, to which Hackenbush retorts, 'You don't look as though you ever met a healthy woman.\" Pressured into demonstrating how he conducts an examination, Hackenbush, aided by Tony and Stuffy, manages to postpone doing so by repeated hand washing and other diversionary tactics. The examination eventually erupts into mayhem when Stuffy sets off the fire sprinkler, and the trio escapes riding Hi Hat.Hackenbush, Tony, Stuffy, and Gil hide out with Hi Hat in a remote barn next to an African-American community. Judy arrives with blankets and Gil reassures her about the future. The locals are enjoying their day of rest with song and dance. The kids are fascinated by Stuffy, whom they identify as the angel Gabriel; Stuffy plays a tin whistle and leads them in a dance. A girl (Ivie Anderson) sings \"All God's Children Got Rhythm.\" Then the sheriff arrives along with Morgan to confiscate Hi Hat. Upon hearing Morgan's voice, Hi Hat bolts and clears a tall hedge with ease. Judy and Gil realize that the horse is a jumper, not a sprinter, which means he's more suited to steeplechase racing, and that Hi Hat's animosity toward Morgan can be used to advantage.The day of the big steeplechase has arrived, but all will be lost if Hi Hat cannot make the post time. Staking out the track, the sheriff once again wrests control of Hi Hat, but then Judy gets the horse back by staging a road accident.Meanwhile, Hackenbush, Tony and Stuffy come up with various and hilarious stratagems for delaying the start of the race. To Morgan's dismay, Stuffy appears at the last moment on Hi Hat, ready to race. After seeing Morgan's photo, Hi Hat easily makes the first jump, but then Stuffy loses the picture. Hackenbush comes up with an alternate plan - he finds a microphone hooked up to the public address system and gets Morgan to talk into it, thus energizing Hi Hat. The jockey of Morgan's horse has been instructed to play dirty, and does so. Eventually Hi Hat and Morgan's horse wind up falling into a big mud puddle. They recover and race to the finish, with Morgan's jockey edging out Stuffy. Judy and Gil's disappointment is palpable, but when Morgan arrives to claim the prize, the winning horse reacts negatively to him and Stuffy realizes that it is really Hi Hat - the jockeys had switched horses in the mud. The race is won, the sanitarium is saved, Judy and Gil can marry, and most amazing of all, Hackenbush proposes marriage to Mrs. Upjohn!","description_full":"The Standish sanitarium, located in the resort town of Sparkling Springs Lake, has fallen on hard times.

Morgan needs the sanitarium property in order to expand his racetrack and resort hotel empire, and is conniving to have the sanitarium fail, aided by Judy's oily business manager, Whitmore (Leonard Ceeley), who is secretly in cahoots with Morgan.Judy's last hope is to request financial assistance from her most well-heeled client, the wealthy widow (and hypochondriac) Mrs. Emily Upjohn (Margaret Dumont). To Judy's dismay, Mrs. Upjohn storms into the lobby and announces that she is leaving. The incompetent medical staff has had the nerve to tell her there is nothing wrong with her. Mrs. Upjohn yearns for the ministrations of Dr. Hugo Z. Hackenbush, since \"I never knew a thing was wrong with me before I met him.\" Overhearing this exchange, Judy's loyal man-of-all-work Tony (Chico Marx) announces that Dr. Hackenbush will soon be arriving. He then rushes off to telegraph Hackenbush offering him a job. As Tony observes, \"If she want a hack-in-de-puss, she gonna get a hack-in-de-puss.\"Judy's fiancé Gil Stewart (Allan Jones) is hoping to make it as a singer, but in the meantime has come up with a quicker plan to earn enough to save the sanitarium and marry Judy. He has sunk all his savings into purchasing a race horse called Hi Hat, to be ridden by an eccentric local mute jockey named Stuffy (Harpo Marx). A couple of realities intrude on Gil's plan. Hi Hat's practice times are mediocre, and Gil has no money to keep up with the horse's expenses, causing the local sheriff (Robert Middlemass) to come after the horse to repossess it for the unpaid feed bill. Fortunately, some sleight-of-hand by Tony and Stuffy keeps the sheriff at bay for the time being. Gil is also dismayed that he has a sure thing tip for a race that afternoon, but no money to bet. Tony reassures him that he will get some money by finding a sucker.In Florida, Dr. Hugo Z. Hackenbush (Groucho Marx) is treating one of his clients, a horse, when the telegram arrives with the job offer. Aware that they can put a veterinarian in jail for treating people, he observes that he can also be put in jail for not paying his rent and has nothing to lose. Soon he arrives at Standish Sanitarium, where Judy appoints him chief of staff at the behest of Mrs. Upjohn, who has agreed to pay Hackenbush's salary and has hinted that she may help the sanitarium financially. The rest of the medical staff, and the scheming business manager Whitmore, are suspicious of Hackenbush's credentials, but he manages to double talk his way around them, and then, at the sound of the bugle call, heads for the racetrack. On his way to place a bet on Sunup, Hackenbush encounters Tony in the guise of an ice cream vendor. Tony offers a hot tip, which turns out to be in code, which a variety of code books and reference works are needed to interpret. After spending a wad of cash on useless books, Hackenbush winds up with a losing horse while Tony bets the profits on the winner - Sunup!Whitmore attempts to verify Hackenbush's credentials with the Florida Medical Board, but Hackenbush manages to divert the calls, to Whitmore's frustration. In order to keep an eye on Whitmore, Tony brings Stuffy into the sanitarium for treatment. During Hackenbush's examination of Stuffy, Tony discovers that Hackenbush is really a horse doctor. Hackenbush wants to flee, but Tony insists that he stay to try to help Judy. At the water carnival, where Gil is the featured vocalist, Hackenbush escorts Mrs. Upjohn but is distracted by a voluptuous blonde named Flo (Esther Muir), with whom he performs an energetic rumba and arranges a late-night rendezvous. Tony and Stuffy invade the bandstand and treat the audience to a comic musical performance. Afterwards, Stuffy overhears that Flo has been hired by Whitmore to lure Hackenbush into a compromising situation. He manages to convey this information to Tony, and the two rush to the rescue. Flo arrives at Hackenbush's suite at the sanitarium for a late night supper. Hackenbush tries to romance Flo, but Tony and Stuffy keep interrupting, first as house detectives, then as decorators hanging wallpaper. At the crucial moment, Whitmore leads the indignant Mrs. Upjohn to Hackenbush's suite, but Flo is safely hidden inside the sofa under a pile of wallpaper, and Mrs. Upjohn redirects her anger to Whitmore.Stuffy hides the horse in a room in the sanitarium. In a further attempt to discredit Hackenbush, Whitmore has brought in Dr. Steinberg (Sig Ruman), a pointy-bearded Austrian physician, to examine Mrs. Upjohn. Steinberg declares that he has never met a healthier woman in his life, to which Hackenbush retorts, 'You don't look as though you ever met a healthy woman.\" Pressured into demonstrating how he conducts an examination, Hackenbush, aided by Tony and Stuffy, manages to postpone doing so by repeated hand washing and other diversionary tactics. The examination eventually erupts into mayhem when Stuffy sets off the fire sprinkler, and the trio escapes riding Hi Hat.Hackenbush, Tony, Stuffy, and Gil hide out with Hi Hat in a remote barn next to an African-American community. Judy arrives with blankets and Gil reassures her about the future. The locals are enjoying their day of rest with song and dance. The kids are fascinated by Stuffy, whom they identify as the angel Gabriel; Stuffy plays a tin whistle and leads them in a dance. A girl (Ivie Anderson) sings \"All God's Children Got Rhythm.\" Then the sheriff arrives along with Morgan to confiscate Hi Hat. Upon hearing Morgan's voice, Hi Hat bolts and clears a tall hedge with ease. Judy and Gil realize that the horse is a jumper, not a sprinter, which means he's more suited to steeplechase racing, and that Hi Hat's animosity toward Morgan can be used to advantage.The day of the big steeplechase has arrived, but all will be lost if Hi Hat cannot make the post time. Staking out the track, the sheriff once again wrests control of Hi Hat, but then Judy gets the horse back by staging a road accident.Meanwhile, Hackenbush, Tony and Stuffy come up with various and hilarious stratagems for delaying the start of the race. To Morgan's dismay, Stuffy appears at the last moment on Hi Hat, ready to race. After seeing Morgan's photo, Hi Hat easily makes the first jump, but then Stuffy loses the picture. Hackenbush comes up with an alternate plan - he finds a microphone hooked up to the public address system and gets Morgan to talk into it, thus energizing Hi Hat. The jockey of Morgan's horse has been instructed to play dirty, and does so. Eventually Hi Hat and Morgan's horse wind up falling into a big mud puddle. They recover and race to the finish, with Morgan's jockey edging out Stuffy. Judy and Gil's disappointment is palpable, but when Morgan arrives to claim the prize, the winning horse reacts negatively to him and Stuffy realizes that it is really Hi Hat - the jockeys had switched horses in the mud. The race is won, the sanitarium is saved, Judy and Gil can marry, and most amazing of all, Hackenbush proposes marriage to Mrs. Upjohn!","synopsis":"The Standish sanitarium, located in the resort town of Sparkling Springs Lake, has fallen on hard times.

Due to the extreme cold he is born with a frozen heart which will not beat. The attendant midwife Madeleine saves his life by replacing his heart with a fragile but working cuckoo clock. She then advises him of three rules to prevent his untimely death; he must never play with the hands of the clock, he must never lose his temper, and finally he must never fall in love. Jack's mother, for reasons known only to her, quickly decides her child would be better raised by Madeleine and departs, leaving Jack. Madeleine, incapable of bearing her own children, raises and loves him as her own.On Jack's tenth birthday, Madeleine repeats the three rules before taking him into town for the first time. He meets a girl in town named Miss Acacia and becomes infatuated with her. After starting school shortly afterward, he also meets Joe, a bully who is in love with Miss Acacia as well. Jealous, the older boy and his gang of students torment Jack for the next four years.

He had been looking for an opportunity to further punish Jack and explains to her the three rules of Jack's cuckoo clock heart in an attempt to sabotage them. Miss Acacia, after talking with Joe, decides she doesn't want to risk being the cause of death of Jack by allowing him to fall in love. She rejects him, and leaves with Joe. Jack, after being rejected, tears at the screws of his heart.In the carriage with Miss Acacia and Joe, he tells her that soon after Jack escaped with Madeleine's help, Madeleine was sent to prison.

Mel has motion sickness, and Jules tells her to take a minute to calm down. Seth (James Snyder) and Matt (Dave Power) arrive and introduce themselves to them. Jules takes Mel into the bathroom, where Mel tells her that she has broken up with her fiance.While they are waiting for their baggage, Mel communicates with a deaf girl, showing off her sign language skills, and Jules waits for the bags. Jules gets her bag, but Mel's isn't there, and the people at the airport tell her that she will need to come back the next day and collect it. They go outside and wait for a shuttle bus and one pulls up. The Driver of another bus (Tony Curran) tells Mel to ask the bus driver how much he will charge and he tells them $60. The Driver says he will do it for $30. They arrive on the bus and are greeted by the creepy Andy (Cullen Douglas). Seth and Matt arrive, and The Driver tries to get them to go away, but Jules tells him that the guys are with her.They board the bus, and Seth sits next to Jules, with Matt sitting next to Mel. The driver takes a strange route, and Mel decides to show Matt her signing skills. After this, they are run off the road by a strange car, and the Driver gets out to survey the damage. He tells them that they have a flat tyre. Jules opts to call a taxi, but there is no service where they are. Matt offers to help change the tyre. While his hand is on top of the tyre, The Driver looks for some nuts for the wheel. Mel turns her back for a second, and the bus falls on Matt's hand. When they get it up, his fingers have been cut off. Seth gives Matt his shirt to cover his fingers, and they drive off to the hospital.Later, it appears that The Driver is lost, and he pulls out a map. Seth starts to get mad at him, until he pulls out a gun and orders them all to sit down at the back. He tells them he wants money. Andy offers his wallet, but he refuses to take it. He takes everyone's phones from them instead. Mel and Seth argue about doing something, and Mel tells them that they need to stop what is going on. Jules finds a flare under the seat, and Mel comes up with a plan to get the window open. Andy sees her and causes a commotion, with Seth getting involved too. Andy pulls the lid off, and Mel throws the flare into the boot. The Driver sees this, stops the bus and removes the flare. Jules runs for the front and finds the door locked and the key missing. She beeps the horn instead.The Driver re-enters and points a gun at both Seth and Andy. He pretends to shoot Andy but instead pulls out a switchblade and slashes Seth's face. He drives them to an ATM booth, and Jules goes in to get some money out. While she is inside, she knocks some paper into a bin and sets it on fire. The Driver sees this, and rushes towards her, but she slams the door. Mel escapes, but The Driver shouts at her that he will let Jules suffocate if she doesn't come back. She has no choice but to surrender.He then takes them to a supermarket, where he tells Mel to go inside with the money and buy some supplies and a large bottle of water, and nothing else. He tells her if she tries to alert anyone he will kill everyone. On the bus, he chains Seth and Andy together and makes them take people's valuables and passports from their bags, and tells Jules and Matt to strap themselves in so they can't escape. Seth tells Andy if he gets loose, The Driver can only get one of them. Mel sees a security camera and signs into it that she needs some help, before giving the cashier a note telling her to check the security tapes when she leaves. Seth gets free and makes a run for it, only to be run over by the bus right in front of Mel.

As the opening credits scroll across the screen \"Hooray for Hollywood\" is played by an unseen orchestra. The song continues as the action begins. We see several signs: \"Clark Gable Beware!,\" then a trumpet player improvises; \"Kay Francis Here He Comes!,\" then a saxophone player plays; \"Leslie Howard Watch Your Step!,\" then a trombone player plays a lick; \"Garbo I Tank You Like Him!,\" then a string bass player slaps his bass; \"Olivia de Havilland Your Midsummer Nights Dream Is On His Way!,\" and then Benny Goodman (himself) improvises on his clarinet (all instrumentalists are members of Goodman's band). The camera reveals that each of these instrumentalists and many other members of the band are in a motorcade, with each person in a different car with a different sign plastered on the front of each car. They are parading, under police escort, to the St. Louis Airport. Once they arrive, they continue the song with Georgia (Johnnie Scat Davis) and Alice (Frances Langford) singing the lyrics; then, the band members also sing. The band is seeing one of its saxophone players, Ronnie Bowers (Dick Powell), off to Hollywood; he has signed a ten-week movie contract with Miracle Pictures; the studio's motto is: \"Miracle Pictures Studio, If Its a Good Picture, Its a Miracle.\" As his plane taxies away from the loading area, the band launches into \"California, Here I Come.\"\nThe next sequence is a montage of various Hollywood sights as \"Hooray for Hollywood\" plays in the background. Ronnie is met at the airport by Bernie Walton (Allyn Joslyn) from the Miracle Pictures publicity department. The studio photographer takes a couple of shots of his arrival, after which he is escorted to the Hollywood Hotel, where he'll be staying.\nThe scene switches to the hotel suite of film star Mona Marshall (Lola Lane) where the famous gossip columnist, Louella Parsons (herself), is interviewing Miss Marshall while she is being fitted with a gown to wear to the premier of her newest film. Mona is ranting and raving and thoroughly overacting about everything. She is the prototypical spoiled, self-absorbed female movie star. When she learns that someone else has been cast in the lead role of a film she had coveted, she refuses to appear at the premier of her film that evening. Instead, she and her assistant leave town.\nThe studio head is in a panic when he learns the star of his film will not appear at the premier. The studio publicity man, Bernie, comes up with a solution. Hell find a double to stand-in for Mona. After Bernie auditions several women, he chooses Virginia Stanton (Rosemary Lane) as Monas substitute (Rosemary and Lola Lane are sisters, so there is a definite resemblance). To escort her to the premier, he selects Ronnie Bowers, the new guy the studio has signed to a short term contract.\nBernie and the studios make-up crew take Virginia to Monas Hollywood Hotel penthouse suite and transform her into a Mona look-a-like. Ronnie is thrilled that his first night in Hollywood he will be escorting the famous Mona Marshall to her film premier. When he gets to the penthouse, a call comes from the front desk that Alexander DuPrey (Alan Mowbray), Mona's co-star in \"Glamour Girl,\" is coming up to escort her to the premier. Bernie has told the maid not allow anyone except Ronnie into Monas suite. When she hears that DuPrey is coming up, she panics. Ronnie, however, rescues the situation by socking DuPrey to keep him out of Monas suite.\nAt the premier at Cathay Circle, the announcer interviewing the stars as they arrive is future President of the United States, a very young Ronald Reagan.\nAfter the premier, Ronnie and Mona/Virginia return to the Hollywood Hotel's Orchid Room for a party. As they dance together, she tells him shes tired of all the photographs and autograph seekers, so they walk out into a garden area where they sit by a fountain pool. As she dunks her toes into the cool water, he sings \"I'm Like a Fish Out of Water.\" After he sings a chorus, she sings as they dance together in the fountain. During this number, Monas sister, Dot (Mabel Todd), chases Fuzzy (Ted Healy), who is trying to avoid her, into the garden where they sing a chorus of the song. Ronnie and Mona/Virginia hide when they see Dot and Fuzzy coming (Virginia is certain Dot will realize that she isnt Mona) and turn on the fountain which soaks both of them. As the song concludes, Ronnie and Mona/Virginia kiss.\nWhen Mona reads the morning paper and sees a photo of Virginia posing as her at the premier, she explodes. She rushes to the studio and demands they fire both Virginia and Ronnie. When Ronnie arrives for his appointment with the head of the studio, Mona storms out of the office and slaps him when he calls her darling. Bernie informs Ronnie that the studio head has fired him. Completely confused, Ronnie goes with Bernie to a coffee shop where Virginia is the waitress, which confuses Ronnie even more. Before anyone can explain, he stalks out of the coffee shop. When he encounters Mona as she is leaving the hotel, she slaps him again. Finally, Bernie explains to Ronnie that it was Virginia he escorted to the premier. Ronnie and Virginia are out on a sightseeing date when they climb over a hill to the Hollywood Bowl. To illustrate the Bowl's exceptional acoustics, Virginia sings \"Silhouetted in the Moonlight\" from the stage while Ronnie remains on the hill.\nAfter being summarily fired, Ronnie acquires Fuzzy as his manager. Ronnie and Fuzzy see Benny Goodman, Alice and Georgia on a Hollywood street corner and learn that the band has been booked at the Hollywood Hotel.\nRonnie and Fuzzy find work as waiters at Callaghan's, a drive-in restaurant. Virginia comes by the drive-in and agrees to wait for Ronnie until he gets off.\nThe scene switches to the Orchid Room where Benny Goodman introduces the song, \"Let That Be a Lesson to You.\" Georgia sings the lyrics, but suddenly the scene switches back to the drive-in where Ronnie sings a lyric about himself as he serves Virginia a milk shake. Later, Virginia and most of the drive-ins customers also join in the song. Dot, who also shows up at the drive-in, sings a chorus to Fuzzy.\nA director from Miracle Studio happens to be a customer at Callaghan's and hears the performance. He tells Ronnie he wants to hire him. Virginia tries to talk Ronnie and Fuzzy out of quitting their waiting jobs, but they wont listen.\nWhen Ronnie and Fuzzy arrive at the film location the next day, they discover that the director wants Ronnie to dub the singing voice of Alexander DuPrey.\nIn a rehearsal sequence, Benny Goodman and His Orchestra play \"Sing, Sing, Sing,\" which features Gene Krupa's marvelous extended drum solo and solos by Harry James on trumpet and Benny Goodman on clarinet. Then, Goodman's quartet (Lionel Hampton on vibes, Teddy Wilson on piano, Gene Krupa on drums and Goodman on clarinet) plays \"I've Got a Heartful of Music.\" At the preview screening of Mona Marshall and Alexander DuPrey's film \"Love & Glory,\" Ronnie sings \"I've Hitched My Wagon to a Star\" as DuPrey mouths the lyrics on screen. Even though Ronnie's voice doesn't fit DuPrey, everyone is impressed with DuPrey's vocal abilities. Louella Parsons asks him to sing on her radio show. He accepts, but later panics when Mona asks whose voice he will use. Ronnie has disappeared and the studio cant locate him. They call Virginia for help and she finds him working as a waiter at Callaghan's drive-in again. Ronnie, however, doesn't want to dub for DuPrey any more. If he sings, he says, he wants it to be his face on the screen.\nVirginia cooks up an idea. Again posing as Mona, Virginia picks up DuPrey to accompany him to Louella's radio program. Fuzzy is the chauffeur and Mona's father, Chester (Hugh Herbert), is also along to help. They drive until DuPrey demands he be let out of the car. They gladly let him out, but by then, it is too late for him to make the radio show.\nThe CBS broadcast begins with Raymond Paige and His Orchestra (themselves) performing a reprise of \"Silhouetted in the Moonlight.\" Jerry Cooper, Paige's male vocalist, and Alice are the vocal soloists. Next, Paige, his instrumentalists and a chorus perform \"Dark Eyes\" in their jazz symphonique style. Then, Louella Parsons introduces Ronnie and Mona to perform a scene from \"Love & Glory.\" During this sequence, Ronnie reprises \"I've Hitched My Wagon to a Star.\"\nEverybody (Ronnie, Virginia, Georgia, Alice, Mona, Jerry, Dot, Fuzzy, and the chorus) gets involved in the finale, \"Sing, You Son of a Gun,\" which evolves into a final reprise of \"Hooray for Hollywood.\"","description_full":"The film opens with a telephone operator connecting a call to the Hollywood Hotel.

To escort her to the premier, he selects Ronnie Bowers, the new guy the studio has signed to a short term contract.\nBernie and the studios make-up crew take Virginia to Monas Hollywood Hotel penthouse suite and transform her into a Mona look-a-like. Ronnie is thrilled that his first night in Hollywood he will be escorting the famous Mona Marshall to her film premier. When he gets to the penthouse, a call comes from the front desk that Alexander DuPrey (Alan Mowbray), Mona's co-star in \"Glamour Girl,\" is coming up to escort her to the premier. Bernie has told the maid not allow anyone except Ronnie into Monas suite. When she hears that DuPrey is coming up, she panics. Ronnie, however, rescues the situation by socking DuPrey to keep him out of Monas suite.\nAt the premier at Cathay Circle, the announcer interviewing the stars as they arrive is future President of the United States, a very young Ronald Reagan.\nAfter the premier, Ronnie and Mona/Virginia return to the Hollywood Hotel's Orchid Room for a party. As they dance together, she tells him shes tired of all the photographs and autograph seekers, so they walk out into a garden area where they sit by a fountain pool. As she dunks her toes into the cool water, he sings \"I'm Like a Fish Out of Water.\" After he sings a chorus, she sings as they dance together in the fountain. During this number, Monas sister, Dot (Mabel Todd), chases Fuzzy (Ted Healy), who is trying to avoid her, into the garden where they sing a chorus of the song. Ronnie and Mona/Virginia hide when they see Dot and Fuzzy coming (Virginia is certain Dot will realize that she isnt Mona) and turn on the fountain which soaks both of them. As the song concludes, Ronnie and Mona/Virginia kiss.\nWhen Mona reads the morning paper and sees a photo of Virginia posing as her at the premier, she explodes. She rushes to the studio and demands they fire both Virginia and Ronnie. When Ronnie arrives for his appointment with the head of the studio, Mona storms out of the office and slaps him when he calls her darling. Bernie informs Ronnie that the studio head has fired him. Completely confused, Ronnie goes with Bernie to a coffee shop where Virginia is the waitress, which confuses Ronnie even more. Before anyone can explain, he stalks out of the coffee shop. When he encounters Mona as she is leaving the hotel, she slaps him again. Finally, Bernie explains to Ronnie that it was Virginia he escorted to the premier. Ronnie and Virginia are out on a sightseeing date when they climb over a hill to the Hollywood Bowl. To illustrate the Bowl's exceptional acoustics, Virginia sings \"Silhouetted in the Moonlight\" from the stage while Ronnie remains on the hill.\nAfter being summarily fired, Ronnie acquires Fuzzy as his manager. Ronnie and Fuzzy see Benny Goodman, Alice and Georgia on a Hollywood street corner and learn that the band has been booked at the Hollywood Hotel.\nRonnie and Fuzzy find work as waiters at Callaghan's, a drive-in restaurant. Virginia comes by the drive-in and agrees to wait for Ronnie until he gets off.\nThe scene switches to the Orchid Room where Benny Goodman introduces the song, \"Let That Be a Lesson to You.\" Georgia sings the lyrics, but suddenly the scene switches back to the drive-in where Ronnie sings a lyric about himself as he serves Virginia a milk shake. Later, Virginia and most of the drive-ins customers also join in the song. Dot, who also shows up at the drive-in, sings a chorus to Fuzzy.\nA director from Miracle Studio happens to be a customer at Callaghan's and hears the performance. He tells Ronnie he wants to hire him. Virginia tries to talk Ronnie and Fuzzy out of quitting their waiting jobs, but they wont listen.\nWhen Ronnie and Fuzzy arrive at the film location the next day, they discover that the director wants Ronnie to dub the singing voice of Alexander DuPrey.\nIn a rehearsal sequence, Benny Goodman and His Orchestra play \"Sing, Sing, Sing,\" which features Gene Krupa's marvelous extended drum solo and solos by Harry James on trumpet and Benny Goodman on clarinet. Then, Goodman's quartet (Lionel Hampton on vibes, Teddy Wilson on piano, Gene Krupa on drums and Goodman on clarinet) plays \"I've Got a Heartful of Music.\" At the preview screening of Mona Marshall and Alexander DuPrey's film \"Love & Glory,\" Ronnie sings \"I've Hitched My Wagon to a Star\" as DuPrey mouths the lyrics on screen. Even though Ronnie's voice doesn't fit DuPrey, everyone is impressed with DuPrey's vocal abilities. Louella Parsons asks him to sing on her radio show. He accepts, but later panics when Mona asks whose voice he will use. Ronnie has disappeared and the studio cant locate him. They call Virginia for help and she finds him working as a waiter at Callaghan's drive-in again. Ronnie, however, doesn't want to dub for DuPrey any more. If he sings, he says, he wants it to be his face on the screen.\nVirginia cooks up an idea. Again posing as Mona, Virginia picks up DuPrey to accompany him to Louella's radio program. Fuzzy is the chauffeur and Mona's father, Chester (Hugh Herbert), is also along to help. They drive until DuPrey demands he be let out of the car. They gladly let him out, but by then, it is too late for him to make the radio show.\nThe CBS broadcast begins with Raymond Paige and His Orchestra (themselves) performing a reprise of \"Silhouetted in the Moonlight.\" Jerry Cooper, Paige's male vocalist, and Alice are the vocal soloists. Next, Paige, his instrumentalists and a chorus perform \"Dark Eyes\" in their jazz symphonique style. Then, Louella Parsons introduces Ronnie and Mona to perform a scene from \"Love & Glory.\" During this sequence, Ronnie reprises \"I've Hitched My Wagon to a Star.\"\nEverybody (Ronnie, Virginia, Georgia, Alice, Mona, Jerry, Dot, Fuzzy, and the chorus) gets involved in the finale, \"Sing, You Son of a Gun,\" which evolves into a final reprise of \"Hooray for Hollywood.\"","yt_trailer_code":"","language":"en","mpa_rating":"","background_image":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/hollywood_hotel_1937/background.jpg","background_image_original":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/hollywood_hotel_1937/background.jpg","small_cover_image":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/hollywood_hotel_1937/small-cover.jpg","medium_cover_image":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/hollywood_hotel_1937/medium-cover.jpg","large_cover_image":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/hollywood_hotel_1937/large-cover.jpg","state":"ok","torrents":[{"url":"https://yts.mx/torrent/download/93CD3695D0D638066F5F1195724A7A59D4564C62","hash":"93CD3695D0D638066F5F1195724A7A59D4564C62","quality":"720p","type":"web","is_repack":"0","video_codec":"x264","bit_depth":"8","audio_channels":"2.0","seeds":28,"peers":4,"size":"1006.33 MB","size_bytes":1055213486,"date_uploaded":"2023-10-19 01:41:40","date_uploaded_unix":1697672500},{"url":"https://yts.mx/torrent/download/CA0AF7BAAB3B889C1EAD5A5098374814CF84022E","hash":"CA0AF7BAAB3B889C1EAD5A5098374814CF84022E","quality":"1080p","type":"web","is_repack":"0","video_codec":"x264","bit_depth":"8","audio_channels":"2.0","seeds":59,"peers":11,"size":"1.82 GB","size_bytes":1954210120,"date_uploaded":"2023-10-19 02:48:26","date_uploaded_unix":1697676506}],"date_uploaded":"2023-10-19 01:41:40","date_uploaded_unix":1697672500},{"id":56648,"url":"https://yts.mx/movies/jind-mahi-2022","imdb_code":"tt15170506","title":"Jind Mahi","title_english":"Jind Mahi","title_long":"Jind Mahi (2022)","slug":"jind-mahi-2022","year":2022,"rating":5.6,"runtime":130,"genres":["Romance"],"summary":"","description_full":"","synopsis":"","yt_trailer_code":"7-N4ssZc0cc","language":"pa","mpa_rating":"","background_image":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/jind_mahi_2022/background.jpg","background_image_original":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/jind_mahi_2022/background.jpg","small_cover_image":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/jind_mahi_2022/small-cover.jpg","medium_cover_image":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/jind_mahi_2022/medium-cover.jpg","large_cover_image":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/jind_mahi_2022/large-cover.jpg","state":"ok","torrents":[{"url":"https://yts.mx/torrent/download/0906D3F2061C2638F423C968F72B33C61DCBDA10","hash":"0906D3F2061C2638F423C968F72B33C61DCBDA10","quality":"720p","type":"web","is_repack":"0","video_codec":"x264","bit_depth":"8","audio_channels":"2.0","seeds":23,"peers":7,"size":"1.16 GB","size_bytes":1245540516,"date_uploaded":"2023-10-18 12:03:16","date_uploaded_unix":1697623396},{"url":"https://yts.mx/torrent/download/691090F02C3553C1A73A3E11686B1DFC3F23757F","hash":"691090F02C3553C1A73A3E11686B1DFC3F23757F","quality":"1080p","type":"web","is_repack":"0","video_codec":"x264","bit_depth":"8","audio_channels":"5.1","seeds":0,"peers":100,"size":"2.38 GB","size_bytes":2555505541,"date_uploaded":"2023-10-18 13:18:12","date_uploaded_unix":1697627892}],"date_uploaded":"2023-10-18 12:03:16","date_uploaded_unix":1697623396},{"id":56643,"url":"https://yts.mx/movies/the-first-grader-2010","imdb_code":"tt0790663","title":"The First Grader","title_english":"The First Grader","title_long":"The First Grader (2010)","slug":"the-first-grader-2010","year":2010,"rating":7.4,"runtime":103,"genres":["Biography","Drama","Romance"],"summary":"Set in a mountain village in Kenya the film tells the remarkable true and uplifting story of a proud old Mau Mau veteran who is determined to seize his last chance to learn to read and write - and so ends up joining a class alongside six year-olds.

Her life changes when he touches her and they begin to fall truly, madly in love.But the Spices are suddenly angry and jealous, and things soon start to go sour in her relationships with her other customers. Haroun gets in an accident, Geeta's family situation does not improve, Jagjit falls in with the wrong crowd at school, and Kwesi's girlfriend breaks up with him. Doug comes to meet her that night and sadly tells her that his Native American-born mother had died.Tilo recognizes that the source of these misfortunes is her breaking of the rules. The First Mother comes to her in a vision and scolds her for choosing Doug over the Spices. She vows that she will return to India, and posts a notice about a closing sale. She goes all out to help her customers one last time and tells the Spices that she will spend just one night with Doug, and then she will give herself utterly to them. She closes the store and goes off with Doug for the night. After a sweet night of romantic, passionate love-making, she leaves him a note that she must leave and cannot return, but that she will always truly, madly and deeply love him forever. Then she goes back to the store and sets the Spices on fire, with her at the center of the flames, as a sign of eternal servitude and slavery to the mystical Spices.Doug comes searching for her, and finds the store devastated. But Tilo has not been burned after all; she is still there, alive and barely conscious. There is no sign of a fire, but there has been an earthquake. We see a vision of the First Mother sitting at the beach, telling her that because she demonstrated her willingness to give up everything for the Spices, now she can have everything she desires and the Spices will never desert her again. Doug agrees to help her rebuild the store, and she happily reunites with him as they walk along the beach holding hands; their blossoming romantic relationship as strong and pure as ever.","yt_trailer_code":"YPRvUkkG6QA","language":"en","mpa_rating":"PG-13","background_image":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/the_mistress_of_spices_2005/background.jpg","background_image_original":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/the_mistress_of_spices_2005/background.jpg","small_cover_image":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/the_mistress_of_spices_2005/small-cover.jpg","medium_cover_image":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/the_mistress_of_spices_2005/medium-cover.jpg","large_cover_image":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/the_mistress_of_spices_2005/large-cover.jpg","state":"ok","torrents":[{"url":"https://yts.mx/torrent/download/BCDD32E06DD94569BD7633D57C4351C7C121510A","hash":"BCDD32E06DD94569BD7633D57C4351C7C121510A","quality":"720p","type":"web","is_repack":"0","video_codec":"x264","bit_depth":"8","audio_channels":"2.0","seeds":55,"peers":17,"size":"882.22 MB","size_bytes":925074719,"date_uploaded":"2023-10-18 20:24:16","date_uploaded_unix":1697653456},{"url":"https://yts.mx/torrent/download/AB2695FB13770D6A027FAAF2780BFE5C8953D47B","hash":"AB2695FB13770D6A027FAAF2780BFE5C8953D47B","quality":"1080p","type":"web","is_repack":"0","video_codec":"x264","bit_depth":"8","audio_channels":"5.1","seeds":67,"peers":20,"size":"1.77 GB","size_bytes":1900523028,"date_uploaded":"2023-10-18 21:39:46","date_uploaded_unix":1697657986}],"date_uploaded":"2023-10-18 20:24:16","date_uploaded_unix":1697653456},{"id":56615,"url":"https://yts.mx/movies/a-very-english-christmas-2023","imdb_code":"tt28505029","title":"A Very English Christmas","title_english":"A Very English Christmas","title_long":"A Very English Christmas (2023)","slug":"a-very-english-christmas-2023","year":2023,"rating":0,"runtime":0,"genres":["Romance"],"summary":"","description_full":"","synopsis":"","yt_trailer_code":"L1--cbcThJc","language":"en","mpa_rating":"","background_image":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/a_very_english_christmas_2023/background.jpg","background_image_original":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/a_very_english_christmas_2023/background.jpg","small_cover_image":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/a_very_english_christmas_2023/small-cover.jpg","medium_cover_image":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/a_very_english_christmas_2023/medium-cover.jpg","large_cover_image":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/a_very_english_christmas_2023/large-cover.jpg","state":"ok","torrents":[{"url":"https://yts.mx/torrent/download/FB6A5FFCD771F1A44E812108B4FC2432B32C7A60","hash":"FB6A5FFCD771F1A44E812108B4FC2432B32C7A60","quality":"720p","type":"web","is_repack":"0","video_codec":"x264","bit_depth":"8","audio_channels":"2.0","seeds":81,"peers":9,"size":"823.9 MB","size_bytes":863921766,"date_uploaded":"2023-10-17 15:52:26","date_uploaded_unix":1697550746},{"url":"https://yts.mx/torrent/download/2385731A0757870DD218D7D03922AC7CBA1DA97B","hash":"2385731A0757870DD218D7D03922AC7CBA1DA97B","quality":"1080p","type":"web","is_repack":"0","video_codec":"x264","bit_depth":"8","audio_channels":"5.1","seeds":80,"peers":9,"size":"1.65 GB","size_bytes":1771674010,"date_uploaded":"2023-10-17 17:07:42","date_uploaded_unix":1697555262}],"date_uploaded":"2023-10-17 15:52:26","date_uploaded_unix":1697550746},{"id":56613,"url":"https://yts.mx/movies/japanese-story-2003","imdb_code":"tt0304229","title":"Japanese Story","title_english":"Japanese Story","title_long":"Japanese Story (2003)","slug":"japanese-story-2003","year":2003,"rating":6.8,"runtime":0,"genres":["Drama","Romance"],"summary":"Sandy, a geologist, finds herself stuck on a field trip to the Pilbara desert with a Japanese man she finds inscrutable, annoying and decidedly arrogant.

The relevance of the opening isn't explained for some time as the movie shifts gears to a detailed look into the life of Michael Burrows, a criminal profiler for the San Francisco Police Department. Much of the film is shot in a documentary style, ostensibly as a part of a dissertation by a film school grad who follows Michael through the movie. Fired from the force after his haemophobia lets a murderer get away, he drifts about in a deep depression for several weeks before coming up with a way to combine his obsession with the Darwin Awards with his talent for profiling: help insurance companies detect, before they're sold insurance policies, people that are likely to end their own lives accidentally. After impressing a manager at the insurance company with his talent for profiling, he's paired up with Siri, a specialist in 'weird' insurance cases.Siri and Michael travel the country investigating several legendary examples of stupidity on behalf of the insurance company, such as the above mentioned JATO rocket car, not all of which would qualify as 'Darwin Awards'. For example, a pair of men who are attempting to ice fish get frustrated and try to use a stick of dynamite to blast a hole in the ice only to have their trusty black lab fetch the stick of dynamite, run back to their brand-new SUV, and sink it to the bottom of the lake without either man being killed. As they investigate those and other cases, Michael tries to find a common factor in these people; the closest the movie gets to an explanation is a confused monologue by Siri about insurance companies always denying claims and driving people insane.Ironically, Michael narrowly avoids becoming a Darwin Award winner throughout the movie. In one instance, he and Siri are stranded out in the middle of nowhere on a cold winter night. Desperate for warmth, he attempts to set a fire with gasoline to get warm only to blow up his own car. In a later scene, Siri confronts Michael, accusing him of being so obsessed with the Darwin Award winners because he suspects he's one of them.A twist of fate leads to Michael finding out where the murder suspect he let get away lives. As he attempts to videotape the man in his home by rappelling down the side of his building, the film school student is seen for the first time. He, too, is hanging on the side of the building by a rope- with the other end of the same rope Michael is dangling by. The stone vase the pair is anchored by inches closer to the edge as the serial killer taunts them from the roof, slicing open his own hand in an effort to trigger Michael's haemophobia. Michael is able to overcome his haemophobia, defeat the serial killer, and live happily ever after with Siri.-----------KrystelClaire's summaryThe film opens with desert scenery, and within it, a secondary road. A dude with a pink sports car uses a JATO engine to drive. Fade to black, and sound of the car crashing onto something.A voiceover explains the idea behind the Darwin Awards, given to people who did something so stupid which killed them, and so, removing themselves from the possibility of passing their dumb genes onto their offspring. Cut to a skyscraper, where aggressive executive Chris Hunter (Alessandro Nivola) shows off to two of his friends (Ross Patterson & Russell Steinberg) to prove that the glass is unbreakable and bullet-proof. He takes a cushion and jumps... as it happens to his death.Cut to Michael Burrows (Joseph Fiennes), a criminal profiler for the San Francisco Police Department. It's decided that a documentary will be done about the way he works, so a cameraman (Wilmer Valderrama) will follow him everywhere. Two other detectives (Adonal Foyle and Tom Wright) wonder if the director should be there. Michael finds him a nuisance. He remembers when he realised that he can focus more than anyone else - on fourth grade, Michael (Max Common) realised that one of his fellow students (Vincent Brubaker) was the culprit of a prank, and so the whole class was punished without going out to the playground for the whole year. The boy hit Michael in front of his friends (Elias Stefanek, Zosha Stefanek & Emma C. Taylor) to make him not betray him, Michael's nose bled, he felt dizzy and passed out. It was found out that he had haemophobia - fear of blood.Michael and the film maker are followed by a serial killer (Tim Blake Nelson). Michael is reading a book about his condition, but as he finds it useless, he throws it in a rubbish bin. He says that he's already done the killer's profile: a short man with literary studies. Michael realises that the killer is following them and he arrests him. As the film maker doesn't want to call the police - he would have to let go of his camera - that gives the opportunity for the killer to attack Burrows. Burrows handcuffs him anyway, but in the ensuing fight, the killer's nose bleeds. Michael passes out, the killer runs away and he punches the film director.The film director keeps on recording Burrows, now expelled from the police because of his illness. Michael keeps on investigating from home - the cue is given by all the bills he has to pay, including insurance. He talks to an insurance executive (Kevin Dunn) to get a job with his company analysing risk-taking people. At first, the exec doesn't pay much attention, but Michael is able to rip his life apart describing every detail: his lovers, his spending habits, his use of slips as underwear which is causing fertility problems for him. Michael thinks that he will be able to profile people who take stupid risks. Michael also gives the example of fat men (R.J. Owens, Bruce Lee Sage & Bob Sáenz) who use soap bars in the shower, and when they try to pick up the bar, they die because they slip in the shower. Finally, the exec decides to give Michael an opportunity, as there are weird cases all over the United States which are costing the company millions. Michael doesn't want to travel, but he has to take the opportunity as it is.He is paired with Siri Taylor (Winona Ryder), who investigates weird death cases. She is investigating a wacko cases in which Emile Travers (Ty Burrell) died in a freak case. There is blood all over the place, so Michael faints once again. The Zippy Cola dispensing machine won't work, so he tries to take the can of cola he's already paid for by introducing his arm through the slot, as he does with another dispensing machine which offers snacks. In the latter case he's successful, and steals a snack. He gets stuck, and the shopping mall where he's at closes for the night - and one of the cleaning men can't help him because he's wearing huge headphones as protection against the noise of the cleaning machine. Moreover, the mall is closing for the whole weekend. So Emile tries to pull his arm out. He finally succeeds in releasing himself, but the dispensing machine stumbles back and forth, and finally falls to the ground, smashing Emile as though he were a bug. As with the case of the jumping executive, Michael can picture himself being in that person's shoes doing the weird things that person did. Michael guessed that she had counted the coins and then falls to the ground.Siri thinks that the legs of the Zippy Cola machine were faulty, so the insurance company will have to pay, but Michael proves otherwise, saving Zippy Cola millions of dollars.Then, they go to Olson, Minnesota, to prove that the car robbery was fake, because in 32 there weren't any robberies there. Michael takes his own cutlery with him.Michael focuses on the display fish on the wall of the owner of the stolen 4x4, Mr. Bob Sparrow (Max Perlich) while his wife Mrs. Sparrow (Mary Saudargas) offers them tea and biscuits. The only description he gives of the criminals is \"weird men from the city\". They go to a frozen lake. As Siri believes that accidents happen out of the blue, they argue. Siri walks on the ice; she slips down and lands on her back - that way, she realises that there's a frozen fish in a tree. Mr Sparrow is going through his midlife crisis, and buys the expensive car. One drinking day spent with his buddy Tom (Chris Penn), bored to death, and they decide to use dynamite to fish out of boredom. They are crappy dynamite users, so they use one to break the ice. But the dog of one of them brings them their dynamite. They run away, they even try to shoot the dog Max, but Max leaves the dynamite under the brand new car. When it explodes, that's the end of the car, and Mr Sparrow falls onto the hole and into the freezing water river. His buddy tries to take him out using his shotgun, which wounds him a little bit. So they throw it in the lake, which immediately freezes again. The police take the car out of the river. Michael thinks that Siri found the key to the crime with sheer luck, but Siri says that sometimes to have to take the risk of making a fool of yourself to accomplish things. Michael thinks that bravery equals stupidity many times.Michael and Siri visit the wounded friend onto hospital.They leave for Wendover, Nevada to investigate the disappearance of the wacko driver from the beginning. If they prove that there was a suicide attempt, there's no obligation for the company to pay.Harvey Weston (David Arquette) likes shooting at old cars with his friend Stan (Brad Hunt).He's the man driving the pink car at the beginning. They are close to a gas station where Joleen (Juliette Lewis) works. Harvey admires a flashy red sports car. Joleen and Harvey make love, and Michael imagines himself making love to Joleen.Harvey and Stan buy Army tools from two ex-Army soldiers (Myth Busters Adam Savage &Jamie Hyneman). There are grenades, masks... but they finally buy the engine of a military jet. Harvey drives the car with the intention of \"being on TV\". The engine is designed to empower jets of 200 tonnes, but Harvey's Chevrolet was only two. The car ended being at 650 kilometers per hour. He can't stop the car because the tyres melt at 400 km/h and the hand brake is ineffectual. He turns right, which causes the car to fly at 30 meters high until it crashes against a small steep. Mr. Pearlman (Richmond Arquette) watches it, and thinks it's a UFO. Mrs Pearlman (Nora Dunn) thinks that her husband is eccentric, and that he was distracted by they two quarrelling children (Allie Busch & Matthew Busch). The married couple talk to Siri and Michael. Siri refuses to pay insurance for somebody who has done such a daredevil thing.They argue. Siri kisses him passionately to give him an opportunity to talk to a cashier called Zoe (Robin Tunney), pretending to split up with Siri. Siri thinks Zoe is desperate for sex and that she'll offer some \"consolation\" to Michael.Michael ties himself with a weird harness in the shower, but it gets stuck. As usual, the film director won't help him, so Siri, in revenge, showers his camera. At that moment is when Joy phones him. Michael tells her he'll phone her in a minute, and Siri leaves him there.Siri thinks that Michael is obsessed with the Darwin Awards because he's afraid he'll die in a stupid way.A female executive, Carla (Julianna Margulies), in a plane is shown how the automatic pilot works by the pilot (Rod Arrants) himself. That gives her an idea: while driving a van she leaves the driving seat. She turns the automatic pilot on and then gives a blow job to her lover Henry (Tom Hollander). They cause a car driver (Debbie Brubaker) and a lorry driver to swerve wildly. The van crashes into a dentist (Josh Kornbluth)'s office, who was trying to calm down a panicky patient, Mr. Harris (Mickey Breitenstein). The intrusion of the van causes the dentist to hurt Mr Harries, who sues him. However, the marks of the executive's teeth on the dick of her partner are proof enough.They drive to another location; they get lost and stuck in the middle of nowhere. Siri's phone is out of battery. Michael's phone flies away because he was trying to get some network. They try to fight the cold night by burning some petrol, thus setting fire to the whole car. Only when the batteries of the camera are dead will the film director take the trouble to use his working mobile phone with network. Siri and Michael hit him for not speaking before.In Tacoma, Washington. Michael mentions two people who bring disgrace to others, but who are themselves immune to harm. Simon (Judah Friedlander) and his buddy Farley (Lukas Haas) go to a Metallica concert in a dirty van and already drinking some beer. Simon's mother (Nancy Clausen) wonders whether Simon has stolen money from her purse. They have to wait outside because the contact who is supposed to sell them their tickets doesn't show up. They try to buy the tickets from two fans (Jason Foster & Lindsay Benner) by giving them 200 bucks, marijuana and even their van. Simon remembers how Lisa Cummings sucked him off in that van, but complains that he's still a virgin.They try to jump the wall inside the concert's venue. Simon ends up hanging in a tree.

The relevance of the opening isn't explained for some time as the movie shifts gears to a detailed look into the life of Michael Burrows, a criminal profiler for the San Francisco Police Department. Much of the film is shot in a documentary style, ostensibly as a part of a dissertation by a film school grad who follows Michael through the movie. Fired from the force after his haemophobia lets a murderer get away, he drifts about in a deep depression for several weeks before coming up with a way to combine his obsession with the Darwin Awards with his talent for profiling: help insurance companies detect, before they're sold insurance policies, people that are likely to end their own lives accidentally. After impressing a manager at the insurance company with his talent for profiling, he's paired up with Siri, a specialist in 'weird' insurance cases.Siri and Michael travel the country investigating several legendary examples of stupidity on behalf of the insurance company, such as the above mentioned JATO rocket car, not all of which would qualify as 'Darwin Awards'. For example, a pair of men who are attempting to ice fish get frustrated and try to use a stick of dynamite to blast a hole in the ice only to have their trusty black lab fetch the stick of dynamite, run back to their brand-new SUV, and sink it to the bottom of the lake without either man being killed. As they investigate those and other cases, Michael tries to find a common factor in these people; the closest the movie gets to an explanation is a confused monologue by Siri about insurance companies always denying claims and driving people insane.Ironically, Michael narrowly avoids becoming a Darwin Award winner throughout the movie. In one instance, he and Siri are stranded out in the middle of nowhere on a cold winter night. Desperate for warmth, he attempts to set a fire with gasoline to get warm only to blow up his own car. In a later scene, Siri confronts Michael, accusing him of being so obsessed with the Darwin Award winners because he suspects he's one of them.A twist of fate leads to Michael finding out where the murder suspect he let get away lives. As he attempts to videotape the man in his home by rappelling down the side of his building, the film school student is seen for the first time. He, too, is hanging on the side of the building by a rope- with the other end of the same rope Michael is dangling by. The stone vase the pair is anchored by inches closer to the edge as the serial killer taunts them from the roof, slicing open his own hand in an effort to trigger Michael's haemophobia. Michael is able to overcome his haemophobia, defeat the serial killer, and live happily ever after with Siri.-----------KrystelClaire's summaryThe film opens with desert scenery, and within it, a secondary road. A dude with a pink sports car uses a JATO engine to drive. Fade to black, and sound of the car crashing onto something.A voiceover explains the idea behind the Darwin Awards, given to people who did something so stupid which killed them, and so, removing themselves from the possibility of passing their dumb genes onto their offspring. Cut to a skyscraper, where aggressive executive Chris Hunter (Alessandro Nivola) shows off to two of his friends (Ross Patterson & Russell Steinberg) to prove that the glass is unbreakable and bullet-proof. He takes a cushion and jumps... as it happens to his death.Cut to Michael Burrows (Joseph Fiennes), a criminal profiler for the San Francisco Police Department. It's decided that a documentary will be done about the way he works, so a cameraman (Wilmer Valderrama) will follow him everywhere. Two other detectives (Adonal Foyle and Tom Wright) wonder if the director should be there. Michael finds him a nuisance. He remembers when he realised that he can focus more than anyone else - on fourth grade, Michael (Max Common) realised that one of his fellow students (Vincent Brubaker) was the culprit of a prank, and so the whole class was punished without going out to the playground for the whole year. The boy hit Michael in front of his friends (Elias Stefanek, Zosha Stefanek & Emma C. Taylor) to make him not betray him, Michael's nose bled, he felt dizzy and passed out. It was found out that he had haemophobia - fear of blood.Michael and the film maker are followed by a serial killer (Tim Blake Nelson). Michael is reading a book about his condition, but as he finds it useless, he throws it in a rubbish bin. He says that he's already done the killer's profile: a short man with literary studies. Michael realises that the killer is following them and he arrests him. As the film maker doesn't want to call the police - he would have to let go of his camera - that gives the opportunity for the killer to attack Burrows. Burrows handcuffs him anyway, but in the ensuing fight, the killer's nose bleeds. Michael passes out, the killer runs away and he punches the film director.The film director keeps on recording Burrows, now expelled from the police because of his illness. Michael keeps on investigating from home - the cue is given by all the bills he has to pay, including insurance. He talks to an insurance executive (Kevin Dunn) to get a job with his company analysing risk-taking people. At first, the exec doesn't pay much attention, but Michael is able to rip his life apart describing every detail: his lovers, his spending habits, his use of slips as underwear which is causing fertility problems for him. Michael thinks that he will be able to profile people who take stupid risks. Michael also gives the example of fat men (R.J. Owens, Bruce Lee Sage & Bob Sáenz) who use soap bars in the shower, and when they try to pick up the bar, they die because they slip in the shower. Finally, the exec decides to give Michael an opportunity, as there are weird cases all over the United States which are costing the company millions. Michael doesn't want to travel, but he has to take the opportunity as it is.He is paired with Siri Taylor (Winona Ryder), who investigates weird death cases. She is investigating a wacko cases in which Emile Travers (Ty Burrell) died in a freak case. There is blood all over the place, so Michael faints once again. The Zippy Cola dispensing machine won't work, so he tries to take the can of cola he's already paid for by introducing his arm through the slot, as he does with another dispensing machine which offers snacks. In the latter case he's successful, and steals a snack. He gets stuck, and the shopping mall where he's at closes for the night - and one of the cleaning men can't help him because he's wearing huge headphones as protection against the noise of the cleaning machine. Moreover, the mall is closing for the whole weekend. So Emile tries to pull his arm out. He finally succeeds in releasing himself, but the dispensing machine stumbles back and forth, and finally falls to the ground, smashing Emile as though he were a bug. As with the case of the jumping executive, Michael can picture himself being in that person's shoes doing the weird things that person did. Michael guessed that she had counted the coins and then falls to the ground.Siri thinks that the legs of the Zippy Cola machine were faulty, so the insurance company will have to pay, but Michael proves otherwise, saving Zippy Cola millions of dollars.Then, they go to Olson, Minnesota, to prove that the car robbery was fake, because in 32 there weren't any robberies there. Michael takes his own cutlery with him.Michael focuses on the display fish on the wall of the owner of the stolen 4x4, Mr. Bob Sparrow (Max Perlich) while his wife Mrs. Sparrow (Mary Saudargas) offers them tea and biscuits. The only description he gives of the criminals is \"weird men from the city\". They go to a frozen lake. As Siri believes that accidents happen out of the blue, they argue. Siri walks on the ice; she slips down and lands on her back - that way, she realises that there's a frozen fish in a tree. Mr Sparrow is going through his midlife crisis, and buys the expensive car. One drinking day spent with his buddy Tom (Chris Penn), bored to death, and they decide to use dynamite to fish out of boredom. They are crappy dynamite users, so they use one to break the ice. But the dog of one of them brings them their dynamite. They run away, they even try to shoot the dog Max, but Max leaves the dynamite under the brand new car. When it explodes, that's the end of the car, and Mr Sparrow falls onto the hole and into the freezing water river. His buddy tries to take him out using his shotgun, which wounds him a little bit. So they throw it in the lake, which immediately freezes again. The police take the car out of the river. Michael thinks that Siri found the key to the crime with sheer luck, but Siri says that sometimes to have to take the risk of making a fool of yourself to accomplish things. Michael thinks that bravery equals stupidity many times.Michael and Siri visit the wounded friend onto hospital.They leave for Wendover, Nevada to investigate the disappearance of the wacko driver from the beginning. If they prove that there was a suicide attempt, there's no obligation for the company to pay.Harvey Weston (David Arquette) likes shooting at old cars with his friend Stan (Brad Hunt).He's the man driving the pink car at the beginning. They are close to a gas station where Joleen (Juliette Lewis) works. Harvey admires a flashy red sports car. Joleen and Harvey make love, and Michael imagines himself making love to Joleen.Harvey and Stan buy Army tools from two ex-Army soldiers (Myth Busters Adam Savage &Jamie Hyneman). There are grenades, masks... but they finally buy the engine of a military jet. Harvey drives the car with the intention of \"being on TV\". The engine is designed to empower jets of 200 tonnes, but Harvey's Chevrolet was only two. The car ended being at 650 kilometers per hour. He can't stop the car because the tyres melt at 400 km/h and the hand brake is ineffectual. He turns right, which causes the car to fly at 30 meters high until it crashes against a small steep. Mr. Pearlman (Richmond Arquette) watches it, and thinks it's a UFO. Mrs Pearlman (Nora Dunn) thinks that her husband is eccentric, and that he was distracted by they two quarrelling children (Allie Busch & Matthew Busch). The married couple talk to Siri and Michael. Siri refuses to pay insurance for somebody who has done such a daredevil thing.They argue. Siri kisses him passionately to give him an opportunity to talk to a cashier called Zoe (Robin Tunney), pretending to split up with Siri. Siri thinks Zoe is desperate for sex and that she'll offer some \"consolation\" to Michael.Michael ties himself with a weird harness in the shower, but it gets stuck. As usual, the film director won't help him, so Siri, in revenge, showers his camera. At that moment is when Joy phones him. Michael tells her he'll phone her in a minute, and Siri leaves him there.Siri thinks that Michael is obsessed with the Darwin Awards because he's afraid he'll die in a stupid way.A female executive, Carla (Julianna Margulies), in a plane is shown how the automatic pilot works by the pilot (Rod Arrants) himself. That gives her an idea: while driving a van she leaves the driving seat. She turns the automatic pilot on and then gives a blow job to her lover Henry (Tom Hollander). They cause a car driver (Debbie Brubaker) and a lorry driver to swerve wildly. The van crashes into a dentist (Josh Kornbluth)'s office, who was trying to calm down a panicky patient, Mr. Harris (Mickey Breitenstein). The intrusion of the van causes the dentist to hurt Mr Harries, who sues him. However, the marks of the executive's teeth on the dick of her partner are proof enough.They drive to another location; they get lost and stuck in the middle of nowhere. Siri's phone is out of battery. Michael's phone flies away because he was trying to get some network. They try to fight the cold night by burning some petrol, thus setting fire to the whole car. Only when the batteries of the camera are dead will the film director take the trouble to use his working mobile phone with network. Siri and Michael hit him for not speaking before.In Tacoma, Washington. Michael mentions two people who bring disgrace to others, but who are themselves immune to harm. Simon (Judah Friedlander) and his buddy Farley (Lukas Haas) go to a Metallica concert in a dirty van and already drinking some beer. Simon's mother (Nancy Clausen) wonders whether Simon has stolen money from her purse. They have to wait outside because the contact who is supposed to sell them their tickets doesn't show up. They try to buy the tickets from two fans (Jason Foster & Lindsay Benner) by giving them 200 bucks, marijuana and even their van. Simon remembers how Lisa Cummings sucked him off in that van, but complains that he's still a virgin.They try to jump the wall inside the concert's venue. Simon ends up hanging in a tree. He cuts the wing of the tree with his knife, intending to fall onto a bush. They smoke some joints while doing that. Finally, Simon falls onto his own knife.

The film director phones Siri, who watches the scene and describes it to him.They go to Lawrence Ferlinghetti's book shop. When they finally talk to him, they lead him to a weird book buyer who tries to pass as a beatnik.Michael hangs himself from a rope and records with the director's heavy camera the killer's apartment from a window. His bloodied boots are there. Siri insists on calling the police, but Michael refuses. The film director hangs himself as well with a smaller lighter camera, which proves to be too heavy for the stone fountain which they have tied the rope to. They tell Siri to go up to the rooftop and secure the fountain.The killer watches them and he goes up to the rooftop and attacks Siri there, who is putting more weight inside the stone decoration. Michael gives his heavy camera to the film director. The imbalance in the weight makes the film director go down and Michael up. He reaches the rooftop and pulls the killer, holding onto his shirt. They all reach the street softly because of the new weight imbalance.Once there, the killer asks Michael why he didn't kill him by letting him go from a height, but Michael said that it was just a reflex on his part. However, the decoration mold falls down onto the killer, who just says that he won't ever go on a drinking binge again. The killer is squashed.The film director gets onto the ambulance recording it. The paramedic (Josh Charles) doesn't want to let him record because of the insurance, but Michael and Siri won't tell on himMetallica dedicates a song to Simon, while his friend watches it from backstage in a wheelchair. He's so dumb that he lights a lighter close to the pyrotechnics which are to be used later for the concert.","yt_trailer_code":"KIEQXIkXrPU","language":"en","mpa_rating":"R","background_image":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/the_darwin_awards_2006/background.jpg","background_image_original":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/the_darwin_awards_2006/background.jpg","small_cover_image":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/the_darwin_awards_2006/small-cover.jpg","medium_cover_image":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/the_darwin_awards_2006/medium-cover.jpg","large_cover_image":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/the_darwin_awards_2006/large-cover.jpg","state":"ok","torrents":[{"url":"https://yts.mx/torrent/download/0F8B4A9198F57608106687AE826CA80D51AD6B5B","hash":"0F8B4A9198F57608106687AE826CA80D51AD6B5B","quality":"480p","type":"bluray","is_repack":"0","video_codec":"x264","bit_depth":"8","audio_channels":"2.0","seeds":74,"peers":6,"size":"798.4 MB","size_bytes":837183078,"date_uploaded":"2023-10-17 18:01:15","date_uploaded_unix":1697558475}]}],[{"id":56728,"url":"https://yts.mx/movies/the-land-unknown-1957","imdb_code":"tt0050622","title":"The Land Unknown","title_english":"The Land Unknown","title_long":"The Land Unknown (1957)","slug":"the-land-unknown-1957","year":1957,"rating":5.7,"runtime":78,"genres":["Adventure","Fantasy","Sci-Fi","Thriller"],"summary":"Four members of a major Antarctic expedition - including Navy Cmdr.

Awoken by strange noises, she checks the interior of the house and sees both of her young children - Jacob and Haley - are fast asleep. After returning downstairs, a grotesque human-like apparition appears and slowly approaches her. As Madison closes her eyes she repeats to herself that it's not real and moments later the creature is gone.The next day, two paranormal investigators do a sweep of the house and hurriedly leave when one seems to capture something terrifying on their EVP device. Jacob and Haley return home from summer camp shortly afterwards and a social worker arrives to see Jacob. The counselor sits with the him and discusses his anger issues which have become a concern following an incident where Jacob beat another boy unconscious. Believing his inability to control his anger stems from guilt surrounding his father's sudden departure, the counselor suggests he writes a letter to him as an exercise in taking responsibility.As the paranormal activities within the house continue to occur more frequently, Madison juggles dealing with them as well as her financial issues and a budding relationship with Jacob's science teacher/camp counselor Nikolai. One day, while out in the garden, Madison is approached by a man named Austin Hamilton claiming to represent a company that's interested in buying her property. He assures her that they're willing to pay a substantial amount that's well over the market value and when Madison asks why he only reveals that her land is critical to their \"future plans\". When Madison tells Hamilton she'll consider it, he gives her his card and says he'll expect to hear from her soon.At the summer camp, a bully named Danny picks on Haley and when he refuses to stop when Jacob intervenes, a fight ensues - Jacob breaking Danny's nose. Furious, Madison chastises her son when they return home and even though she understands he was protecting his sister she tries to make him understand that he cannot keep losing control of his emotions.Later that night, Nikolai comes over to the house for dinner and wine and the two talk briefly about their lives before meeting one another. Madison mentions her former husband's anger issues and how she eventually had had enough - asking him to leave, while Nikolai recalls his past job where he didn't agree with his colleagues' methods and was forced to resign. The two make love and Madison indirectly asks Nikolai to leave as opposed to spending the night.As the family sleeps, objects begin to levitate in Haley's room and a pair of bloodied arms extend down from Jacob's ceiling. Awoken by her son's screams, Madison enters his room to find the apparition gone but suddenly a ghostly bald man dressed in white appears and chases the three throughout the house. Almost appearing to be a hologram, the apparition passes through floors and walls and when it attempts to grab Jacob and Haley it leaves burns on their arms. When Madison and her children attempt to leave the house, Jacob falls unconscious just beyond the front door and Haley is soon to follow. As Madison calls 911 for help and brings the children back inside she hangs up when both Jacob and Haley recover as if nothing is wrong with them.The following day, Madison calls a doctor to come to the house and run a series of tests on her kids - only finding them to be perfectly healthy. When she expresses confusion and refuses to believe that there's nothing wrong with them the doctor promises to run more tests when he returns to the lab but also suggests that the affliction could be psychosomatic.Unsatisfied with the doctor's results, Madison begins to search online for answers - coming across a single case where a scientist could not leave his laboratory for months after conducting experiments with a proton accelerator.Hamilton arrives at the house and continues to put pressure on Madison to sell her property as soon as possible. Believing that she cannot leave due to whatever is afflicting her children, she tells him to give her some more time before starting the paperwork. When Hamilton makes a reference to the fact that her finances are in dire straits, Madison claims harassment and says that she's only one month behind in her mortgage anyways. Hamilton snidely replies by saying that his company, which owns the mortgage agreement, decides how late she is and that foreclosure would not be a desirable situation to be in.After turning Hamilton away, Madison hears a knock on the front door and angrily opens it thinking that the man is refusing to leave her be - instead finding Nikolai. Nikolai greets her and tells her he came to check up on her as he hadn't seen or heard from her for some time. Madison then proceeds to give Nikolai the \"it's not you, it's me\" break-up speech - insisting that there's something she's dealing with that he can't know about and it would be better if they stopped seeing one another. Confused and heartbroken, Nikolai slowly walks away.Inside the house, a disfigured and bloody creature emerges from the dryer and crawls towards Madison who's inexplicably locked into the laundry room. Once she's finally able to force the door open, she huddles in fear with Jacob and Haley as the apparition gets closer and closer. Hearing the screams, Nikolai bursts in and sees the creature before it suddenly disappears in a bright flash of light.Her dark secret revealed, Madison tries to explain to Nikolai the paranormal events that have been plaguing them and attempts to answer his questions regarding when they happen and what kinds of things occur before, during, and afterwards. His scientific curiosity piqued and wanting to help, Nikolai resolves to stay at the home to try and figure out what's actually happening.Contacting a former colleague, Nikolai retrieves equipment to capture and study these paranormal activities while Madison and Jacob meet with his counselor who's disappointed to find that he's engaged in another fight. As the counselor and Madison talk privately, the social worker warns that if Jacob can't get control of his anger soon and continues his violent actions the possibility of keeping him out of juvenile detention is becoming less likely. She also suggests that Madison seek legal counsel as Danny's parents will likely press charges.As Nikolai, Madison, and the kids play Monopoly that night their fun is cut short when the dice begin to levitate - signalling the impending arrival of one of the apparitions. Sure enough, the man in white appears and chases the group through the house, blinking in and out of existence. At one point Madison strikes the man with a chair which breaks upon him and afterwards slams a door on his fingers and severs them - causing him to cry out in a pain before disappearing once more.The severed fingers left behind, things become more mysterious as now they know that not only can they hurt this apparition but he may not be a ghost at all.The next day Madison reviews video footage from the previous night's events while Nikolai and Jacob analyze audio recordings. When Madison zooms in on the man in white's shirt she recognizes a logo that also appears on Hamilton's business card - a logo belonging to a company named CamSET. Going back to the article about the scientist who couldn't leave his lab, she finds that he worked for CamSET and was a part of a team involved in a \"Project ECHO\". Sleuthing further, Madison not only discovers that \"Project ECHO\" was a series of experiments regarding teleportation that was shut down when they were found to be using human test subjects, but that also Nikolai was a part of the group.Confronting Nikolai about his involvement, he swears to Madison that he resigned from the project when they first started using criminals as test subjects. When Madison shows the video still of the man in white's shirt and the logo upon it, Nikolai expresses confusion and disbelief as it seemed that viable teleportation was still thirty or forty years away when he resigned.Believing that CamSET is trying to scare them off the property they desperately want, Madison resolves to fight back by killing the man in white and hopefully stopping these \"paranormal activities\" once and for all. Making a series of improvised weapons and setting traps, the group awaits the inevitable return of the \"ghost\" that night.When he eventually begins to appear, Madison hides Jacob and Haley in the basement while Nikolai attempts to distract the \"apparition\". As this occurs, Hamilton arrives at the house and relentlessly bangs on the front door. Suddenly, the door flies open and Hamilton is dragged inside by the man in white and savagely attacked. As Hamilton, mortally wounded, crawls from the house he places a call to the police before succumbing to his wounds.As Madison and Nikolai go on the offensive, they manage to wound the man in white several times but he continues to pursue them. Eventually, Nikolai is hurt but the \"ghost\" falls into a trap and he and Madison return to the house. Two police officers soon arrive and investigate - coming across Nikolai and Madison, the latter leading them into the basement to retrieve Jacob and Haley.When Nikolai realizes that the man in white is no longer stuck in the trap he appears out of thin air and slits one officer's throat with a knife before knocking Nikolai unconscious and breaking the neck of the second policeman. As the \"ghost\" approaches Madison and her children in the basement he hesitates when he sees various objects (a baseball glove, a picture, a science fair volcano, etc) strewn about.Taking advantage of this, Madison lunges at the man but he stabs her in the stomach and she falls to the ground. As Jacob approaches him he slashes the boy across the face and Madison watches as a long scar begins to form on the man in white's face. Nikolai comes to and shoots the \"ghost\" - appearing to kill him.As the group huddles around a dying Madison, Nikolai attempts to stop the bleeding from her wound but seemingly to no avail. Knowing that the man in white will be teleported back to wherever he came from she curls up next to him and disappears in a flash of light.Now in the future, we see two men escorting the man in white to be teleported back in time - one of the men explaining that this particular \"subject\" proved to be more resilient than his predecessors despite having his brain \"scrambled\". When the other asks where they got the man, he explains that he was taken prisoner after attempting to bomb CamSET's facilities in revenge for his mother's death.Madison awakens in a bright-lit room next to her older son - the man in white - as scientists sound an alarm.Back in the present, more police officers arrive and begin searching the house and recovering dead bodies. In a flash of light, Madison reappears, alive and healthy, and embraces Jacob as the film ends.","description_full":"The film opens as single mother Madison sleeps in front of her laptop computer which is open on a webpage concerning filing for bankruptcy.

Going back to the article about the scientist who couldn't leave his lab, she finds that he worked for CamSET and was a part of a team involved in a \"Project ECHO\". Sleuthing further, Madison not only discovers that \"Project ECHO\" was a series of experiments regarding teleportation that was shut down when they were found to be using human test subjects, but that also Nikolai was a part of the group.Confronting Nikolai about his involvement, he swears to Madison that he resigned from the project when they first started using criminals as test subjects. When Madison shows the video still of the man in white's shirt and the logo upon it, Nikolai expresses confusion and disbelief as it seemed that viable teleportation was still thirty or forty years away when he resigned.Believing that CamSET is trying to scare them off the property they desperately want, Madison resolves to fight back by killing the man in white and hopefully stopping these \"paranormal activities\" once and for all. Making a series of improvised weapons and setting traps, the group awaits the inevitable return of the \"ghost\" that night.When he eventually begins to appear, Madison hides Jacob and Haley in the basement while Nikolai attempts to distract the \"apparition\". As this occurs, Hamilton arrives at the house and relentlessly bangs on the front door. Suddenly, the door flies open and Hamilton is dragged inside by the man in white and savagely attacked. As Hamilton, mortally wounded, crawls from the house he places a call to the police before succumbing to his wounds.As Madison and Nikolai go on the offensive, they manage to wound the man in white several times but he continues to pursue them. Eventually, Nikolai is hurt but the \"ghost\" falls into a trap and he and Madison return to the house. Two police officers soon arrive and investigate - coming across Nikolai and Madison, the latter leading them into the basement to retrieve Jacob and Haley.When Nikolai realizes that the man in white is no longer stuck in the trap he appears out of thin air and slits one officer's throat with a knife before knocking Nikolai unconscious and breaking the neck of the second policeman. As the \"ghost\" approaches Madison and her children in the basement he hesitates when he sees various objects (a baseball glove, a picture, a science fair volcano, etc) strewn about.Taking advantage of this, Madison lunges at the man but he stabs her in the stomach and she falls to the ground. As Jacob approaches him he slashes the boy across the face and Madison watches as a long scar begins to form on the man in white's face. Nikolai comes to and shoots the \"ghost\" - appearing to kill him.As the group huddles around a dying Madison, Nikolai attempts to stop the bleeding from her wound but seemingly to no avail. Knowing that the man in white will be teleported back to wherever he came from she curls up next to him and disappears in a flash of light.Now in the future, we see two men escorting the man in white to be teleported back in time - one of the men explaining that this particular \"subject\" proved to be more resilient than his predecessors despite having his brain \"scrambled\". When the other asks where they got the man, he explains that he was taken prisoner after attempting to bomb CamSET's facilities in revenge for his mother's death.Madison awakens in a bright-lit room next to her older son - the man in white - as scientists sound an alarm.Back in the present, more police officers arrive and begin searching the house and recovering dead bodies. In a flash of light, Madison reappears, alive and healthy, and embraces Jacob as the film ends.","yt_trailer_code":"WW_uPxP_KVA","language":"en","mpa_rating":"","background_image":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/the_diabolical_2015/background.jpg","background_image_original":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/the_diabolical_2015/background.jpg","small_cover_image":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/the_diabolical_2015/small-cover.jpg","medium_cover_image":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/the_diabolical_2015/medium-cover.jpg","large_cover_image":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/the_diabolical_2015/large-cover.jpg","state":"ok","torrents":[{"url":"https://yts.mx/torrent/download/427AB4E0AE03FDBE2544073032E2774C5C0DA217","hash":"427AB4E0AE03FDBE2544073032E2774C5C0DA217","quality":"720p","type":"bluray","is_repack":"0","video_codec":"x264","bit_depth":"8","audio_channels":"2.0","seeds":45,"peers":2,"size":"794.49 MB","size_bytes":833083146,"date_uploaded":"2023-10-18 20:09:36","date_uploaded_unix":1697652576},{"url":"https://yts.mx/torrent/download/B19E75802FFFDFE4400487CE2DA979ACB233C0B3","hash":"B19E75802FFFDFE4400487CE2DA979ACB233C0B3","quality":"1080p","type":"bluray","is_repack":"0","video_codec":"x264","bit_depth":"8","audio_channels":"5.1","seeds":65,"peers":9,"size":"1.59 GB","size_bytes":1707249500,"date_uploaded":"2023-10-18 21:03:45","date_uploaded_unix":1697655825}],"date_uploaded":"2023-10-18 20:09:36","date_uploaded_unix":1697652576},{"id":56610,"url":"https://yts.mx/movies/the-house-at-the-end-of-time-2013","imdb_code":"tt2640474","title":"The House at the End of Time","title_english":"The House at the End of Time","title_long":"The House at the End of Time (2013)","slug":"the-house-at-the-end-of-time-2013","year":2013,"rating":6.7,"runtime":101,"genres":["Drama","Fantasy","Horror","Mystery","Sci-Fi","Thriller"],"summary":"Dulce is a mother who experiences supernatural incidents in her home that unleash a tragedy.

Acclaimed filmmaker Emir Kusturica traces the remarkable story of soccer legend Diego Maradona in this documentary featuring music by composer Manu Chao and Sex Pistols. Maradona has a reputation as the people's champion, an athlete who rose from humble beginnings to achieve worldwide fame, and who has overcome incredible adversity to become a living legend. As the director and his subject grow increasingly intimate, Maradona reveals details about his life that have never come to light in the public eye.

d'Or awards, Ueli Steck, became popular for climbing the North Face of the Eiger at a record speed of 3 hours and 54 minutes in 2007, and he eventually broke his record the next year by climbing it in 2 hours, 47 minutes, and 33 seconds. Ueli is Swiss. Ueli was more interested in the sports aspect of climbing and not the adventure aspect of it.\nUeli wanted to climb the trilogy of Alpine North Faces in record time.This marked the beginning of Steck's speed-climbing career. He immediately became a media sensation and was considered one of the best Alpinists of all time. Ueli gave birth to modern-style Alpinism, which essentially involved risking his life for the climb. He did not use ropes and solely depended on the grip of his hands and shoes to climb the mountains. Even when the routes were difficult, Ueli always chose to stick to his extreme style of climbing solo and without a harness.Fellow mountain climbers discuss how Ueli Steck was all about discipline and motivation. He is remembered for being extremely hardworking, and he meticulously planned every climb of his. Ueli admitted that he was not a natural athlete, and therefore, to achieve his goals, he had to work extra hard. He trained rigorously, and once he started to climb, he never turned back. For Ueli, mountain climbing was not an adventure he enjoyed; instead, he treated the entire ordeal as a sport where timing and goal were absolutely crucial.\nUeli brings the modern style to Alpinism.The high that he experienced in 2008 made him crave success all the more. He needed to prove himself over and over again, which meant he had to climb more and more mountains.Ueli enjoyed the media attention he received, and he never said no to sponsorship. He paved the path to making a living through mountain climbing, and he was particularly successful in doing so because he had the capability of appealing to a larger crowd. Even though the general audience might not get all of the mountain climbing jargon, they were familiar with speed, time, and the entire sports aspect of it. Ueli eventually managed to climb the remaining two famous north faces of Matterhorn and Grandes Jorasses at record speed as well. By bringing in time, Ueli Steck had unknowingly called for competition. Once a record is set, it is natural for someone else to try to break it. To stay relevant, he had to continue climbing and setting more records, and while he enjoyed every bit of speed climbing, maybe certain things are not meant for competitions, especially if they are life-threatening.Dani Arnold trained to become a mountain guide during his free time. He took an interest in climbing from a young age, and Ueli Steck was an inspiration for him. Steck made him believe that it was possible to earn a living through mountaineering. Dani Arnold followed Steck closely to understand his style, and once he felt confident in himself, he decided to climb the north face of Eiger. Dani knew he was taking on a herculean challenge, but he believed he was ready for it. Climbs that took hours, he could complete in a short span.Dani stated that once he started to climb Eiger, he felt comfortable and did not face trouble increasing his speed. Dani Arnold ended up breaking Ueli Steck's record and setting a new one-two hours and twenty-eight minutes. Dani Arnold kept a low profile, and it was almost unexpected for him to break Steck's record.\nSoon after reaching the summit, Arnold texted Steck because he believed he deserved to be the first one to know about it. But Ueli Steck did not take the competition well.\nUeli was the complete opposite of Dani. Ueli trained hard and was very methodical. Dani was very unorganized but was naturally gifted.The rivalry began when Dani came across a newspaper interview where Ueli belittled his achievement by pointing out that Dani had used a rope during the climb. He went so far as to accuse Dani of cheating, and it showed how insecure he felt at the time. According to Ueli, he was the one who created the idea of a pure climb, and he tried to use it as a differentiating factor between him and his competitor. Dani felt the need to prove himself after the media started to question his achievements as well. He did wish to be taken lightly, and it became important for him to prove to the world that he was worth watching out for.After the Swiss Alps, Ueli Steck shifted his focus to the Himalayas. He was searching for something more challenging, and the south face of Annapurna was perfect for his project since it was extremely dangerous. Even though the climb was severely demanding, Ueli was impossible to stop. Annapurna had a 1:3 death to Summit rate. The rockfalls and the avalanches on the mountain were constant and deadly.\nIt was assumed that Ueli would stop climbing after strong winds started to blow, creating avalanches all across the face, but the next morning, when his team saw Ueli return to the base, it became obvious to them that he did not stop and made it to the summit. Ueli's Annapurna climb became a point of debate since he did not have a single picture taken on the summit. People demanded proof, but there was none. Ueli admitted that he should have carried proof, but then again, several more important things were going through his mind, and safely making it back to the base was the dominating one. While many believe he indeed made it to the top, some argue that it might be untrue. People were left wondering if the media was responsible for pushing Ueli Steck to the point where he had to lie to prove himself.Meanwhile, the media got to Dani Arnold as well after his achievement was repeatedly questioned. To prove himself, he climbed the north face of Matterhorn, and once again, he broke Ueli's record of 1 hours and 56 minutes, by 10 minutes.\nUeli Steck did not comment on his achievement, but the rivalry became obvious to the world when Steck announced that he would speed-climb the North Face of Eiger again. He won back the title of the fastest climb on the North Face of the Eiger by six minutes. The rivalry had turned bitter and petty by then. A competition that could result in death must technically not be celebrated, but that was exactly what was going on. It was either winning or dying at that point. Dani's parents believe that social media plays a huge role in affecting mountaineers. The need for validation has reached an extreme level.Ueli admitted that, as a thirty-eight-year-old, it was not easy for him to accept that he was past his best achievements. He needed to challenge himself over and over again. Ueli Steck died during the Nuptse climb in the Himalayas. He slipped and succumbed to a thousand-meter fall. His body was buried in Kathmandu, Nepal, and a memorial service was held in Switzerland. Ueli Steck was aware of how fatal his style was, and people close to him believed that he was having the time of his life during his last climb. Ueli believed in grand living instead of always playing it safe. Dani Arnold continues to speed climb all across the globe, and Ueli's death shows him how things could end for him. He hopes that he will be able to stop himself at the right time if the circumstances ever turn unfavorable. Dani went on to break Ueli's record once again. He had climbed the north face of Grandes Jorasses in the recorded time of approximately 2 hours and 4 minutes, beating Ueli's record by 17 minutes.The trend of making records in mountain climbing could result in many more deaths. The need for validation and media attention plays a huge role, but then again, it has gone too far to be stopped now. There will be others aiming to break the records that have been set. It all comes down to whether one wants to take in the pure joy of climbing a mountain or even the sport aspect of it or would risk their life primarily for fame and money. Dani admits that it is just a sport, and as difficult as it was for him to accept, it is obvious that someday someone will break his records, and that is the nature of the sport.","description_full":"The winner of two Piolet d'Or awards, Ueli Steck, became popular for climbing the North Face of the Eiger at a record speed of 3 hours and 54 minutes in 2007, and he eventually broke his record the next year by climbing it in 2 hours, 47 minutes, and 33 seconds.

He needed to prove himself over and over again, which meant he had to climb more and more mountains.Ueli enjoyed the media attention he received, and he never said no to sponsorship. He paved the path to making a living through mountain climbing, and he was particularly successful in doing so because he had the capability of appealing to a larger crowd. Even though the general audience might not get all of the mountain climbing jargon, they were familiar with speed, time, and the entire sports aspect of it. Ueli eventually managed to climb the remaining two famous north faces of Matterhorn and Grandes Jorasses at record speed as well. By bringing in time, Ueli Steck had unknowingly called for competition. Once a record is set, it is natural for someone else to try to break it. To stay relevant, he had to continue climbing and setting more records, and while he enjoyed every bit of speed climbing, maybe certain things are not meant for competitions, especially if they are life-threatening.Dani Arnold trained to become a mountain guide during his free time. He took an interest in climbing from a young age, and Ueli Steck was an inspiration for him. Steck made him believe that it was possible to earn a living through mountaineering. Dani Arnold followed Steck closely to understand his style, and once he felt confident in himself, he decided to climb the north face of Eiger. Dani knew he was taking on a herculean challenge, but he believed he was ready for it. Climbs that took hours, he could complete in a short span.Dani stated that once he started to climb Eiger, he felt comfortable and did not face trouble increasing his speed. Dani Arnold ended up breaking Ueli Steck's record and setting a new one-two hours and twenty-eight minutes. Dani Arnold kept a low profile, and it was almost unexpected for him to break Steck's record.\nSoon after reaching the summit, Arnold texted Steck because he believed he deserved to be the first one to know about it. But Ueli Steck did not take the competition well.\nUeli was the complete opposite of Dani. Ueli trained hard and was very methodical. Dani was very unorganized but was naturally gifted.The rivalry began when Dani came across a newspaper interview where Ueli belittled his achievement by pointing out that Dani had used a rope during the climb. He went so far as to accuse Dani of cheating, and it showed how insecure he felt at the time. According to Ueli, he was the one who created the idea of a pure climb, and he tried to use it as a differentiating factor between him and his competitor. Dani felt the need to prove himself after the media started to question his achievements as well. He did wish to be taken lightly, and it became important for him to prove to the world that he was worth watching out for.After the Swiss Alps, Ueli Steck shifted his focus to the Himalayas. He was searching for something more challenging, and the south face of Annapurna was perfect for his project since it was extremely dangerous. Even though the climb was severely demanding, Ueli was impossible to stop. Annapurna had a 1:3 death to Summit rate. The rockfalls and the avalanches on the mountain were constant and deadly.\nIt was assumed that Ueli would stop climbing after strong winds started to blow, creating avalanches all across the face, but the next morning, when his team saw Ueli return to the base, it became obvious to them that he did not stop and made it to the summit. Ueli's Annapurna climb became a point of debate since he did not have a single picture taken on the summit. People demanded proof, but there was none. Ueli admitted that he should have carried proof, but then again, several more important things were going through his mind, and safely making it back to the base was the dominating one. While many believe he indeed made it to the top, some argue that it might be untrue. People were left wondering if the media was responsible for pushing Ueli Steck to the point where he had to lie to prove himself.Meanwhile, the media got to Dani Arnold as well after his achievement was repeatedly questioned. To prove himself, he climbed the north face of Matterhorn, and once again, he broke Ueli's record of 1 hours and 56 minutes, by 10 minutes.\nUeli Steck did not comment on his achievement, but the rivalry became obvious to the world when Steck announced that he would speed-climb the North Face of Eiger again. He won back the title of the fastest climb on the North Face of the Eiger by six minutes. The rivalry had turned bitter and petty by then. A competition that could result in death must technically not be celebrated, but that was exactly what was going on. It was either winning or dying at that point. Dani's parents believe that social media plays a huge role in affecting mountaineers. The need for validation has reached an extreme level.Ueli admitted that, as a thirty-eight-year-old, it was not easy for him to accept that he was past his best achievements. He needed to challenge himself over and over again. Ueli Steck died during the Nuptse climb in the Himalayas. He slipped and succumbed to a thousand-meter fall. His body was buried in Kathmandu, Nepal, and a memorial service was held in Switzerland. Ueli Steck was aware of how fatal his style was, and people close to him believed that he was having the time of his life during his last climb. Ueli believed in grand living instead of always playing it safe. Dani Arnold continues to speed climb all across the globe, and Ueli's death shows him how things could end for him. He hopes that he will be able to stop himself at the right time if the circumstances ever turn unfavorable. Dani went on to break Ueli's record once again. He had climbed the north face of Grandes Jorasses in the recorded time of approximately 2 hours and 4 minutes, beating Ueli's record by 17 minutes.The trend of making records in mountain climbing could result in many more deaths. The need for validation and media attention plays a huge role, but then again, it has gone too far to be stopped now. There will be others aiming to break the records that have been set. It all comes down to whether one wants to take in the pure joy of climbing a mountain or even the sport aspect of it or would risk their life primarily for fame and money. Dani admits that it is just a sport, and as difficult as it was for him to accept, it is obvious that someday someone will break his records, and that is the nature of the sport.","yt_trailer_code":"wEzoqk5jdMs","language":"de","mpa_rating":"","background_image":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/race_to_the_summit_2023/background.jpg","background_image_original":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/race_to_the_summit_2023/background.jpg","small_cover_image":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/race_to_the_summit_2023/small-cover.jpg","medium_cover_image":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/race_to_the_summit_2023/medium-cover.jpg","large_cover_image":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/race_to_the_summit_2023/large-cover.jpg","state":"ok","torrents":[{"url":"https://yts.mx/torrent/download/1C10223D2A5EC3C69AB4382B0B7E81D902A6C17E","hash":"1C10223D2A5EC3C69AB4382B0B7E81D902A6C17E","quality":"720p","type":"web","is_repack":"0","video_codec":"x264","bit_depth":"8","audio_channels":"2.0","seeds":12,"peers":2,"size":"834.74 MB","size_bytes":875288330,"date_uploaded":"2023-10-04 12:09:29","date_uploaded_unix":1696414169},{"url":"https://yts.mx/torrent/download/2A00F4ACCD4177B99F16AB50E7BF7CFCE52A613B","hash":"2A00F4ACCD4177B99F16AB50E7BF7CFCE52A613B","quality":"1080p","type":"web","is_repack":"0","video_codec":"x264","bit_depth":"8","audio_channels":"5.1","seeds":19,"peers":3,"size":"1.67 GB","size_bytes":1793148846,"date_uploaded":"2023-10-04 13:05:27","date_uploaded_unix":1696417527}],"date_uploaded":"2023-10-04 12:09:29","date_uploaded_unix":1696414169},{"id":56188,"url":"https://yts.mx/movies/the-broken-hearts-club-a-romantic-comedy-2000","imdb_code":"tt0222850","title":"The Broken Hearts Club: A Romantic Comedy","title_english":"The Broken Hearts Club: A Romantic Comedy","title_long":"The Broken Hearts Club: A Romantic Comedy (2000)","slug":"the-broken-hearts-club-a-romantic-comedy-2000","year":2000,"rating":6.9,"runtime":94,"genres":["Comedy","Drama","Romance","Sport"],"summary":"In the palm-shaded oasis of West Hollywood, we meet Dennis, a promising photographer.

The academy aims to train and equip students with martial arts in order to uphold justice and combat the threat of the triad gangs in a seemingly lawless world. The academy is also a haven for children who had been orphaned as a result of triad activities.The story begins with the two sons, who were born to different mothers, of Wong, one of the founders of the academy. The elder son is named \"Dragon\" and the younger one is named \"Tiger\". When the boys were still young, Dragon's mother left the academy and gave Dragon half of a jade amulet pendant and told him that his half-brother Tiger has the other half of the pendant. When Dragon's mother was killed in a fire, Dragon was taken into the care of triad boss named Ma Qwun and he grew up to become Ma's bodyguard. Ma Qwun's gang is a subject of the evil Luocha Gate.Several years later, Tiger and his friends are dining in a restaurant and encounter Ma Qwun and his men, who are receiving the Luocha Plaque. The Luocha Plaque is a symbol of authority within the Luocha Gate and indicates that the holder is second only to the Luocha Gate's leader Shibumi. Ma Qwun and the leader of the White Lions Gang wee arguing over the Plaque when Tiger interrupts and starts a fight with the gangsters. They manage to seize the Plaque. Just then, Dragon appears and fights with Tiger, whom he does not recognise to be his half-brother. Ma Qwun calls for Dragon to pull back.Later that night, Dragon confronts Tiger and his friends at a Japanese restaurant to take back the Plaque. Tiger and his friends have been drugged by Scaly, another of Ma's lackeys, who also wanted to seize back the Plaque to prove to his boss that he is the better man. Scaly and his followers fight Dragon over possession of the Plaque. Turbo Shek, another diner at the restaurant, is aroused by the commotion and he joins in the fight on Dragon's side. Dragon and Turbo defeat Scaly and his men and Tiger takes back the Plaque from Dragon. Just then, he discovers that Dragon has the other half of the jade amulet pendant and realises that Dragon is actually his half-brother.Turbo follows Tiger back to Dragon Tiger Gate and wants to be enrolled into the academy to improve his martial arts. He is refused by the current leader of the academy, Master Wong Fuk Fu for his arrogance. Dismayed, Turbo waits outside the academy and promises not to leave unless he is accepted in as student.

These films are in fact the first cinematographic record, the first \"gaze\" in the philosophical sense, into the soul of the region. As the title implies, the story will take the form of an odyssey that begins in Greece and continues through Albania (the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, known to the Greeks as the Republic of Skopje), Bulgaria, Rumania, Serbia, and finally Bosnia.The film opens with an old black and white silent film that shows some village women weaving. In a voice-over, Harvey Keitel comments, \"Weavers in Avdella, a Greek Village, 1905, the first film made by the brothers Miltiades and Yannakis Manakis, [who filmed] all the ambiguities, the contrasts, the conflicts in this area of the world.\" For those of you who would watch \"Ulysses' Gaze\" only to find out if these three films ever existed, you now know the answer, and you don't have to watch to the end.

Cavafi, in his poem \"Ithaca\" (1911): \"When you start on your journey to Ithaca, / then pray that the road is long, / full of adventure, full of knowledge\", then you will enjoy the next 180 minutes of the journey.Following this antique piece of film showing the weaving village women, and before the opening titles, we see a small masterpiece of a scene, as only Angelopoulos can produce. An old man, standing on a quay, is getting his old-type camera ready to film a sailing ship coming out of the harbor of Salonika. The old man is Yannakis Manakis, and the scene, which took place in 1954, is recounted to \"A\" out of the camera's field of view by an old man who had been Manakis's assistant at that time. The assistant is not shown as he would have been at the time, but as he is today. While we watch Manakis finish preparing his camera and his assistant standing behind him recounting the event, the films takes on color. As the blue ship appears on the right side of the screen, Manakis is struck by a heart attack and collapses in a chair. The assistant walks toward the right of the screen, all the while continuing with his story. The camera scans to the right, and we discover \"A\" standing. \"A\" walks leftward, passing the point where we had just seen Manakis and his camera, but they are no longer there. We continue following \"A\" walking to the left, until the blue ship reappears in the field of view. The camera now follows the ship, slowly zooming in, until the ship stands still and fills the screen. Eventually, the camera stops tracking the ship and it disappears to the left. We are contemplating a blue-grey sea that dissolves into a sky of the same color. In his long shot, Angelopoulos has covered sixty years, and set the tone for the whole journey.As the film begins, \"A\" (Harvey Keitel) has arrived in a rainy Florina, a town in northern Greece, where one of his films is to be shown. The film is somehow controversial, and religious fanatics plan to demonstrate against its screening. One of the screening organizers advises \"A\" to leave town for his own safety. As \"A\" is about to enter a taxi, a woman (Maia Morgenstern) in her thirties passes him by and \"A,\" apparently stunned, follows her, muttering to himself: \"I did not expect you here.\" She disappears between the groups of demonstrators and counter-demonstrators who face each other. Morgenstern, who plays the roles of four different women in the film, is \"A's\" old love whom he left years ago, and therefore, a Penelope figure. The two groups rush toward each other, but the resulting confrontation is left unseen.Cut to a dreary winter day, with snow on the ground. \"A\" arrives at an Albanian border crossing in a taxi. While the taxi driver (Thanassis Vengos) tends to the police formalities, \"A\" notices an older lady (Dora Volanaki) with a suitcase standing nearby. \"A\" walks toward her, and she asks if he could give her a lift to a town over the border. She plans to visit her sister, whom she has not seen for forty-five years. \"A\" agrees and helps her into the taxi. Just then, a group of people arrives in a bus: they are illegal Albanian immigrants who were rounded up by the Greek police and are being return to their home country. As \"A's\" taxi proceeds across the Albanian side of the border, we see all along the road, in a desolate and gloomy snowy landscape, hundreds of Albanians standing like statues, waiting for a chance to sneak into Greece. The taxi reaches the town of Korytsa, stops in the middle of an empty square, and \"A\" helps the lady out. The taxi leaves, and a tracking-back long shot reveals the isolation and desolation of the town.The taxi continues toward the Macedonian border, but it has to stop because of snow on the road. The friendly taxi driver sensibly decides against a perilous crossing, and settles down, waiting for the snow to be cleared. He engages \"A\" in a conversation while listening to Greek music and drinking. He says, \"Greece is dying.We are dying as a people,\" reflecting on the present situation of Greece and its people.\"A\" arrives, apparently on a bus in Monastiri, in the Republic of Skopje. He is looking for the original home of the Manakis brothers. He stands in front of the door, and the film dissolves into old black and white footage made around 1956 by the Manakis brothers. The house is now a museum, and \"A\" enters. Inside, he briefly meets with a young lady (Maia Morgenstern), who gives him the cold shoulder. Later that evening, on the train to Skopje, \"A\" meets her again. He explains in detail his journey's purpose, and we learn that the young woman's name is Kali, which stands for Calypso, the goddess who held Ulysses captive for seven years on her island, Ogygia.. Kali tells \"A\" that the Manakis' films are not in the Skopje film archives. In Skopje, \"A\" is continuing on by train to Bulgaria and Kali is on the platform. \"A\" recounts to her an event he witnessed two years earlier on the island of Delos. The train has started leaving the station and is picking up speed. Kali is running on the platform alongside the train, fascinated by \"A's\" story. Finally, \"A\" grabs her and pulls her aboard. He continues his story, and Kali is so moved by it that she does not resist \"A's\" passionate embrace. She will now share \"A's\" journey.The train pulls in the station at the border. \"A\" and Kali are asked to step down -- apparently, there is something wrong with \"A's\" passport. Past and present mix once more: the train station alters and \"A\" finds himself being interrogated by an official dressed in turn-of-the-century clothing. \"A\" is now being addressed as if he were Yannakis Manakis. He is accused of sedition against the state of Bulgaria.. Although \"A\" protests that he does not understand, he is blindfolded and taken before a firing squad. At the last moment, a messenger arrives: King Ferdinand of Bulgaria has commuted Yannakis Manakis' sentence to exile until the war (The Balkan war of 1912-13) is over.\"A\" is reunited with Kali outside the contemporary police station. They board another train for Bucharest. As they step off the train, a young women (Mania Papadimitriou) in 1940's dress comes and addresses \"A\" as if he were a child. \"A,\" in turn, calls her \"Mother,\" and he apologizes for missing her funeral. Once more, we find ourselves in a time-warp, where \"A\" has returned to \"his\" childhood. They board a bus that takes them to their old home in Kostantza, on the Black Sea. They enter the house, where all of \"A's\" deceased \"relatives\" are dancing. He greets each one in turn, as a well-mannered child would. A man in rags appears in the room: it is his \"father\" returning from prison. The celebration of the father's return and of the New Year begins. We are in 1945, and there has been a temporary switch in the roles: \"A,\" as Telemachus, is greeting the return of his \"father,\" Ulysses. This is a familiar style that Angelopoulos has used in \"The Travelling Players,\" where this single scene, lasting some fifteen minutes in one continuous shot, covers five years as the characters waltz through the 1948 arrest of an uncle, to the 1950 New Year's Eve celebration, when the family is finally allowed to return to Greece. Through this scene, we now understand that \"A's\" memory has now merged with that of the Manakis' brothers.\"A\" awakens in a contemporary hotel in Kostantza, with Kali at his side. They go to the harbor, where a huge statue of Lenin is being loaded on a barge, in preparation for traveling up the Danube to Germany. A tearful \"A\" tells Kali, \"I cannot love you,\" just as Homer's Ulysses tells Calypso upon leaving her. \"A\" climbs aboard the barge, leaving a bewildered Kali on the quay. As the barge proceeds up the Danube River, groups of people on the riverbank stand in awe, many crossing themselves. This long traveling shot, accompanied by ethereal music, reminds us of the taxi ride in Albania. Toward the end of this shot, Arvanitis' camera, as if looking into Lenin's soul, circles slowly around the broken head of the statue, as a meditation on a ruin of the past.Arriving in Belgrade, \"A\" is met by his old friend, Nikos (Giogos Michalakopoulos) who, paraphrasing Angelopoulos' favorite poet, George Seferis, greats him with, \"When God created the World, the first thing he made were journeys.\" To which \"A\" answers, \"and then came doubt and nostalgia.\" They go to an old people's home, where they meet with an old man who was once in charge of the Belgrade Film Archives. The old man says that the Menakis' films are now with one of his friends at the Sarajevo Film Archives. Nikos and \"A\" end up in a café, drinking to the memories of old friends, and continue their voyage into nostalgia while drinking in the street. Obviously, Belgrade has become Ulysses' descent into Hades in the Odyssey, where he went to meet old friends and get instructions to complete his journey. \"A\" decides that despite the danger, he must go to Sarajevo. Nikos tells him to follow one of the many rivers which lead to it.Night time. \"A,\" asleep in an old shack, is being awakened by a young lady (Maia Morgenstern, yet again). They are in Philipoupolis, Bulgaria, and the year is 1915. Morgenstern now assumes the role of Homer's Circe, the sorceress. She leads \"A\" to the river, and they escape in a small boat. The next scene shows them on a bright morning, floating down the river. The couple eventually lands on the shore of a village in ruins, and they walk to a particular house, which used to be the woman's. The house, gutted by a conflagration, is in ruins. The woman, grief-stricken, desperately calls out, \"Vania!\" the name of her husband, who must have perished during the village's destruction. In the debris, \"A\" finds a picture frame with a turn-of-the-century wedding picture, which most likely is that of the woman and Vania. In a somewhat surrealist scene, a table with a white tablecloth has been set up in the midst of the rubble, and it is there in the evening where \"A\" and his companion have dinner. In the background, the rumble of guns and sharp explosions can be heard.When \"A\" wakes up, he is naked. He wraps himself in a blanket, walks outside, and sees the woman washing his clothes. She comes back to the house and gives him some of her husband's clothes. The woman goes to the river and demolishes the boat with an axe, obviously in order to hold \"A\" captive, as Circe also tried to do with Ulysses. She returns to the house, and seeing \"A\" dressed up in her husband's clothes, pulls him to the floor and makes passionate love to him.In the next scene, in the darkness, \"A\" has escaped Circe. He is drifting down the river in a small boat. At dawn, he arrives in Sarajevo. He eventually finds his way to the Film Archives, where he meets a young boy who takes him to an underground market to meet the Archives curator, a Jewish man by the name of Ivo Levy (Erland Josephson). They walk back to the gutted Film Archives building, each carrying containers of water. The siege of Sarajevo has been going on for some time, and the whole town is in ruins, its infrastructure destroyed. People risk their lives daily while fetching water at some of the still functioning water fountains, braving the bullets of Serbian snipers. Running back to the Film Archives, \"A\" explains to Levy the purpose of his coming to Sarajevo. Levy does have the three films and has tried repeatedly to find the correct chemical formula to develop them, but to no avail. . However, impressed by \"A's\" courage and determination, Levy says, \"You must have great faith, or is it despair?\" and agrees to try one more time.At the Film Archives, \"A\" goes to sleep and when he awakens, he meets a young woman, Levy's daughter, Noami ( Maia Morgenstern in her fourth role), a contemporary Nausicaa;. \"A\" is obviously struck by Noami's familiar face. By now, we understand that \"A\" has projected his past lovers in every woman he meets. Noami leaves, and \"A,\" looking around, sees that Levy has already started to get the lab working again. Later that night, Levy wakes up \"A\" and brings him to his lab where the development of a roll of film is in progress. At last, Levy is successful. \"A\" and the archivist are overwhelmed with joy and they embrace: after almost 100 years of being captive, an image of Greece from the turn of the century has at last been set free.The whole place is now flooded with fog. Levy explains that this is a welcome time for the inhabitants of Sarajevo: because of the fog, the Serbian snipers cannot operate, and the population is free to come outside their shelter and enjoy the open air. As \"A\" and Levy walk past a cemetery, we see some people taking advantage of the lull to bury their dead, Moslem and Orthodox Christians alike. The two friends come across an orchestra playing in a small square. Levy explains that it is made up of young Muslim, Croat, and Serb musicians. There is also a small production of \"Romeo and Juliet\" going on.Further on, some couples are dancing to a rock tune. Out of the fog, Naomi appears and invites \"A\" to dance. The music changes to a 1950s tune, and Naomi has now become the Penelope whom \"A\" had left behind in Florina, long time ago.Levy's family joins the trio and they walk together in the fog toward the river, with Levy and \"A\" straggling behind. Suddenly, there is a noise of a car stopping, doors slamming, and men's voices. Levy tells \"A\" to stay put and runs in the fog to rejoin the rest of the family. We hear Naomi's cry of, \"not the children!\" as gun shots are followed by splashes as bodies are dumped into the water. The car leaves and there is total, eerie silence. Throughout, we stare at the fog, only able to guess at the events that have just occurred. As always, Angelopoulos lets us contemplate the meaning of violence, rather than actually showing it. \"A\" runs to the spot of the massacre where he first finds Levy dead in the snow, and then Naomi. He embraces her, embracing at the same time all the women he has loved and lost. In helpless rage and anger, he releases several heart-wrenching screams. He returns slowly to the Film Archives, passing once more by the still-playing orchestra.The final scene shows a blank projection screen where a film has just been shown, most likely one of the Manakis' films. Then, a close-up shot of \"A,\" followed by a zoom backward, as he speaks Ulysses' lines to Penelope,\"When I return, it will be with another man's clothes\"\"A\" has reached his Ithaca, but his odyssey may not be over yet, as he is now looking toward another Ithaca.","description_full":"In \"Ulysses' Gaze\" (\"To Vlemma Tou Odyssea,\" 1995), a Greek-American filmmaker, not named in the film, and only referred to as \"A\" in the script, is on a quest to find three lost reels of undeveloped film, the first ever produced in Greece, from around 1905. These films are in fact the first cinematographic record, the first \"gaze\" in the philosophical sense, into the soul of the region. As the title implies, the story will take the form of an odyssey that begins in Greece and continues through Albania (the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, known to the Greeks as the Republic of Skopje), Bulgaria, Rumania, Serbia, and finally Bosnia.The film opens with an old black and white silent film that shows some village women weaving. In a voice-over, Harvey Keitel comments, \"Weavers in Avdella, a Greek Village, 1905, the first film made by the brothers Miltiades and Yannakis Manakis, [who filmed] all the ambiguities, the contrasts, the conflicts in this area of the world.\" For those of you who would watch \"Ulysses' Gaze\" only to find out if these three films ever existed, you now know the answer, and you don't have to watch to the end.

As the blue ship appears on the right side of the screen, Manakis is struck by a heart attack and collapses in a chair. The assistant walks toward the right of the screen, all the while continuing with his story. The camera scans to the right, and we discover \"A\" standing. \"A\" walks leftward, passing the point where we had just seen Manakis and his camera, but they are no longer there. We continue following \"A\" walking to the left, until the blue ship reappears in the field of view. The camera now follows the ship, slowly zooming in, until the ship stands still and fills the screen. Eventually, the camera stops tracking the ship and it disappears to the left. We are contemplating a blue-grey sea that dissolves into a sky of the same color. In his long shot, Angelopoulos has covered sixty years, and set the tone for the whole journey.As the film begins, \"A\" (Harvey Keitel) has arrived in a rainy Florina, a town in northern Greece, where one of his films is to be shown. The film is somehow controversial, and religious fanatics plan to demonstrate against its screening. One of the screening organizers advises \"A\" to leave town for his own safety. As \"A\" is about to enter a taxi, a woman (Maia Morgenstern) in her thirties passes him by and \"A,\" apparently stunned, follows her, muttering to himself: \"I did not expect you here.\" She disappears between the groups of demonstrators and counter-demonstrators who face each other. Morgenstern, who plays the roles of four different women in the film, is \"A's\" old love whom he left years ago, and therefore, a Penelope figure. The two groups rush toward each other, but the resulting confrontation is left unseen.Cut to a dreary winter day, with snow on the ground. \"A\" arrives at an Albanian border crossing in a taxi. While the taxi driver (Thanassis Vengos) tends to the police formalities, \"A\" notices an older lady (Dora Volanaki) with a suitcase standing nearby. \"A\" walks toward her, and she asks if he could give her a lift to a town over the border. She plans to visit her sister, whom she has not seen for forty-five years. \"A\" agrees and helps her into the taxi. Just then, a group of people arrives in a bus: they are illegal Albanian immigrants who were rounded up by the Greek police and are being return to their home country. As \"A's\" taxi proceeds across the Albanian side of the border, we see all along the road, in a desolate and gloomy snowy landscape, hundreds of Albanians standing like statues, waiting for a chance to sneak into Greece. The taxi reaches the town of Korytsa, stops in the middle of an empty square, and \"A\" helps the lady out. The taxi leaves, and a tracking-back long shot reveals the isolation and desolation of the town.The taxi continues toward the Macedonian border, but it has to stop because of snow on the road. The friendly taxi driver sensibly decides against a perilous crossing, and settles down, waiting for the snow to be cleared. He engages \"A\" in a conversation while listening to Greek music and drinking. He says, \"Greece is dying.We are dying as a people,\" reflecting on the present situation of Greece and its people.\"A\" arrives, apparently on a bus in Monastiri, in the Republic of Skopje. He is looking for the original home of the Manakis brothers. He stands in front of the door, and the film dissolves into old black and white footage made around 1956 by the Manakis brothers. The house is now a museum, and \"A\" enters. Inside, he briefly meets with a young lady (Maia Morgenstern), who gives him the cold shoulder. Later that evening, on the train to Skopje, \"A\" meets her again. He explains in detail his journey's purpose, and we learn that the young woman's name is Kali, which stands for Calypso, the goddess who held Ulysses captive for seven years on her island, Ogygia.. Kali tells \"A\" that the Manakis' films are not in the Skopje film archives. In Skopje, \"A\" is continuing on by train to Bulgaria and Kali is on the platform. \"A\" recounts to her an event he witnessed two years earlier on the island of Delos. The train has started leaving the station and is picking up speed. Kali is running on the platform alongside the train, fascinated by \"A's\" story. Finally, \"A\" grabs her and pulls her aboard. He continues his story, and Kali is so moved by it that she does not resist \"A's\" passionate embrace. She will now share \"A's\" journey.The train pulls in the station at the border. \"A\" and Kali are asked to step down -- apparently, there is something wrong with \"A's\" passport. Past and present mix once more: the train station alters and \"A\" finds himself being interrogated by an official dressed in turn-of-the-century clothing. \"A\" is now being addressed as if he were Yannakis Manakis. He is accused of sedition against the state of Bulgaria.. Although \"A\" protests that he does not understand, he is blindfolded and taken before a firing squad. At the last moment, a messenger arrives: King Ferdinand of Bulgaria has commuted Yannakis Manakis' sentence to exile until the war (The Balkan war of 1912-13) is over.\"A\" is reunited with Kali outside the contemporary police station. They board another train for Bucharest. As they step off the train, a young women (Mania Papadimitriou) in 1940's dress comes and addresses \"A\" as if he were a child. \"A,\" in turn, calls her \"Mother,\" and he apologizes for missing her funeral. Once more, we find ourselves in a time-warp, where \"A\" has returned to \"his\" childhood. They board a bus that takes them to their old home in Kostantza, on the Black Sea. They enter the house, where all of \"A's\" deceased \"relatives\" are dancing. He greets each one in turn, as a well-mannered child would. A man in rags appears in the room: it is his \"father\" returning from prison. The celebration of the father's return and of the New Year begins. We are in 1945, and there has been a temporary switch in the roles: \"A,\" as Telemachus, is greeting the return of his \"father,\" Ulysses. This is a familiar style that Angelopoulos has used in \"The Travelling Players,\" where this single scene, lasting some fifteen minutes in one continuous shot, covers five years as the characters waltz through the 1948 arrest of an uncle, to the 1950 New Year's Eve celebration, when the family is finally allowed to return to Greece. Through this scene, we now understand that \"A's\" memory has now merged with that of the Manakis' brothers.\"A\" awakens in a contemporary hotel in Kostantza, with Kali at his side. They go to the harbor, where a huge statue of Lenin is being loaded on a barge, in preparation for traveling up the Danube to Germany. A tearful \"A\" tells Kali, \"I cannot love you,\" just as Homer's Ulysses tells Calypso upon leaving her. \"A\" climbs aboard the barge, leaving a bewildered Kali on the quay. As the barge proceeds up the Danube River, groups of people on the riverbank stand in awe, many crossing themselves. This long traveling shot, accompanied by ethereal music, reminds us of the taxi ride in Albania. Toward the end of this shot, Arvanitis' camera, as if looking into Lenin's soul, circles slowly around the broken head of the statue, as a meditation on a ruin of the past.Arriving in Belgrade, \"A\" is met by his old friend, Nikos (Giogos Michalakopoulos) who, paraphrasing Angelopoulos' favorite poet, George Seferis, greats him with, \"When God created the World, the first thing he made were journeys.\" To which \"A\" answers, \"and then came doubt and nostalgia.\" They go to an old people's home, where they meet with an old man who was once in charge of the Belgrade Film Archives. The old man says that the Menakis' films are now with one of his friends at the Sarajevo Film Archives. Nikos and \"A\" end up in a café, drinking to the memories of old friends, and continue their voyage into nostalgia while drinking in the street. Obviously, Belgrade has become Ulysses' descent into Hades in the Odyssey, where he went to meet old friends and get instructions to complete his journey. \"A\" decides that despite the danger, he must go to Sarajevo. Nikos tells him to follow one of the many rivers which lead to it.Night time. \"A,\" asleep in an old shack, is being awakened by a young lady (Maia Morgenstern, yet again). They are in Philipoupolis, Bulgaria, and the year is 1915. Morgenstern now assumes the role of Homer's Circe, the sorceress. She leads \"A\" to the river, and they escape in a small boat. The next scene shows them on a bright morning, floating down the river. The couple eventually lands on the shore of a village in ruins, and they walk to a particular house, which used to be the woman's. The house, gutted by a conflagration, is in ruins. The woman, grief-stricken, desperately calls out, \"Vania!\" the name of her husband, who must have perished during the village's destruction. In the debris, \"A\" finds a picture frame with a turn-of-the-century wedding picture, which most likely is that of the woman and Vania. In a somewhat surrealist scene, a table with a white tablecloth has been set up in the midst of the rubble, and it is there in the evening where \"A\" and his companion have dinner. In the background, the rumble of guns and sharp explosions can be heard.When \"A\" wakes up, he is naked. He wraps himself in a blanket, walks outside, and sees the woman washing his clothes. She comes back to the house and gives him some of her husband's clothes. The woman goes to the river and demolishes the boat with an axe, obviously in order to hold \"A\" captive, as Circe also tried to do with Ulysses. She returns to the house, and seeing \"A\" dressed up in her husband's clothes, pulls him to the floor and makes passionate love to him.In the next scene, in the darkness, \"A\" has escaped Circe. He is drifting down the river in a small boat. At dawn, he arrives in Sarajevo. He eventually finds his way to the Film Archives, where he meets a young boy who takes him to an underground market to meet the Archives curator, a Jewish man by the name of Ivo Levy (Erland Josephson). They walk back to the gutted Film Archives building, each carrying containers of water. The siege of Sarajevo has been going on for some time, and the whole town is in ruins, its infrastructure destroyed. People risk their lives daily while fetching water at some of the still functioning water fountains, braving the bullets of Serbian snipers. Running back to the Film Archives, \"A\" explains to Levy the purpose of his coming to Sarajevo. Levy does have the three films and has tried repeatedly to find the correct chemical formula to develop them, but to no avail. . However, impressed by \"A's\" courage and determination, Levy says, \"You must have great faith, or is it despair?\" and agrees to try one more time.At the Film Archives, \"A\" goes to sleep and when he awakens, he meets a young woman, Levy's daughter, Noami ( Maia Morgenstern in her fourth role), a contemporary Nausicaa;. \"A\" is obviously struck by Noami's familiar face. By now, we understand that \"A\" has projected his past lovers in every woman he meets. Noami leaves, and \"A,\" looking around, sees that Levy has already started to get the lab working again. Later that night, Levy wakes up \"A\" and brings him to his lab where the development of a roll of film is in progress. At last, Levy is successful. \"A\" and the archivist are overwhelmed with joy and they embrace: after almost 100 years of being captive, an image of Greece from the turn of the century has at last been set free.The whole place is now flooded with fog. Levy explains that this is a welcome time for the inhabitants of Sarajevo: because of the fog, the Serbian snipers cannot operate, and the population is free to come outside their shelter and enjoy the open air. As \"A\" and Levy walk past a cemetery, we see some people taking advantage of the lull to bury their dead, Moslem and Orthodox Christians alike. The two friends come across an orchestra playing in a small square. Levy explains that it is made up of young Muslim, Croat, and Serb musicians. There is also a small production of \"Romeo and Juliet\" going on.Further on, some couples are dancing to a rock tune. Out of the fog, Naomi appears and invites \"A\" to dance. The music changes to a 1950s tune, and Naomi has now become the Penelope whom \"A\" had left behind in Florina, long time ago.Levy's family joins the trio and they walk together in the fog toward the river, with Levy and \"A\" straggling behind. Suddenly, there is a noise of a car stopping, doors slamming, and men's voices. Levy tells \"A\" to stay put and runs in the fog to rejoin the rest of the family. We hear Naomi's cry of, \"not the children!\" as gun shots are followed by splashes as bodies are dumped into the water. The car leaves and there is total, eerie silence. Throughout, we stare at the fog, only able to guess at the events that have just occurred. As always, Angelopoulos lets us contemplate the meaning of violence, rather than actually showing it. \"A\" runs to the spot of the massacre where he first finds Levy dead in the snow, and then Naomi. He embraces her, embracing at the same time all the women he has loved and lost. In helpless rage and anger, he releases several heart-wrenching screams. He returns slowly to the Film Archives, passing once more by the still-playing orchestra.The final scene shows a blank projection screen where a film has just been shown, most likely one of the Manakis' films. Then, a close-up shot of \"A,\" followed by a zoom backward, as he speaks Ulysses' lines to Penelope,\"When I return, it will be with another man's clothes\"\"A\" has reached his Ithaca, but his odyssey may not be over yet, as he is now looking toward another Ithaca.","yt_trailer_code":"8VF48LWXCjU","language":"el","mpa_rating":"","background_image":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/ulysses_gaze_1995/background.jpg","background_image_original":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/ulysses_gaze_1995/background.jpg","small_cover_image":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/ulysses_gaze_1995/small-cover.jpg","medium_cover_image":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/ulysses_gaze_1995/medium-cover.jpg","large_cover_image":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/ulysses_gaze_1995/large-cover.jpg","state":"ok","torrents":[{"url":"https://yts.mx/torrent/download/051F112C8883A0D60DDF6D9CBD7BA2DFF4E93E81","hash":"051F112C8883A0D60DDF6D9CBD7BA2DFF4E93E81","quality":"480p","type":"bluray","is_repack":"0","video_codec":"x264","bit_depth":"8","audio_channels":"2.0","seeds":77,"peers":26,"size":"1.46 GB","size_bytes":1567663063,"date_uploaded":"2023-10-20 19:51:42","date_uploaded_unix":1697824302}]},{"id":56620,"url":"https://yts.mx/movies/sajjan-singh-rangroot-2018","imdb_code":"tt7762982","title":"Sajjan Singh Rangroot","title_english":"Sajjan Singh Rangroot","title_long":"Sajjan Singh Rangroot (2018)","slug":"sajjan-singh-rangroot-2018","year":2018,"rating":7.3,"runtime":140,"genres":["Action","Biography","Drama","History","War"],"summary":"This film is based on Sikh regiments that went to the front lines during WWI.

from Boston arrives in Santa Fe to establish her new medical practice. Dr. Julia Garth is set to live with her brother, U.S. Cavalry lieutenant David Garth. The town already has a male physician, Dr. Rourke O'Brien. His tomboy niece, Spurs O'Brien, has a teenage crush on the handsome Cavalry lieutenant David Garth. The first hospital of this community is managed by Catholic priest Father Gabriel Mendoza and a few nuns. However, these are times when female doctors are almost unheard of. Some people even consider it a shameful offense for a woman to intrude in a man's profession. The traditional view is that women's roles should only be limited to the minding of the household and the rearing of children. Therefore, Dr. Julia Garth's arrival in town and her medical practice ruffles many feathers, not the least some of the more conservative townsfolk's. Dr. Rourke O'Brien is no exception. He arrogantly dismisses Julia Garth's competency but he secretly falls in-love with the beautiful Easterner. Dr. Garth also brings to the West the latest medical theories, equipment and innovations. The only positive welcomes she gets are from the peace and harmony loving priest and from the poor Mexican and Indian community. Over time, Dr. Julia Garth has to prove herself a capable and trusted physician and gain the respect and confidence of the whole town. When some of Dr. Rourke O'Brien's patients switch their medical provider by flocking to Dr. Garth's office, O'Brien becomes envious and jealous of Dr. Garth. Nevertheless, there is a powerful attraction between the two and a romance is afoot. Unfortunately, her brother David, an avid poker player, is frequently accused of cheating at cards. When a man accuses him of cheating and also of selling stolen cattle to the army, David completely looses his cool and shoots the man dead. Being afraid of an eventual court-martial, David Garth robs the bank and skips town. The incensed townsfolk order Dr. Julia Garth out of town. It's up to Dr. O'Brien to save the day.—nufs68","description_full":"In 1880 New Mexico, a young female doctor from Boston arrives in Santa Fe to establish her new medical practice.

Vakil Singh (Ranvir Shorey) and Lakhna (Sushant Singh Rajput) are important members of this gang. Man Singh is in need of money to procure new arms. Based on a tip from Lacchu (Jaspal Sharma), he and his men descend to Brahmpuri village. A marriage is taking place in this hamlet where the groom is about to get a huge amount of gold and cash. Man Singh and his gang reaches the marriage venue in order to loot this wealth. However, the cops, led by Virender Gujjar (Ashutosh Rana) ambush the gang. In the tough fight, Man Singh and half of the gang get killed. Vakil, Lakhna and others escape. Vakil, now the leader of the gang, accuses Lakhna of betraying them and calling the cops. Lakhna is fed up of being a rebel and wants to surrender. Meanwhile, as they are running from the cops, they bump into Indumati Tomar (Bhumi Pednekar).
