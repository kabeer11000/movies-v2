In his search for the truth, he involves Lysa Rothman, who worked for Santos and with whom he falls in love. As he gets deeper into trouble with the cops and the real assassin, he not only needs Lysa's help but that of the Indians' leader. How many will die so O'Brien can get his story?—","yt_trailer_code":"0cFgnxW9EQE","language":"en","mpa_rating":"R","background_image":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/fire_on_the_amazon_1993/background.jpg","background_image_original":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/fire_on_the_amazon_1993/background.jpg","small_cover_image":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/fire_on_the_amazon_1993/small-cover.jpg","medium_cover_image":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/fire_on_the_amazon_1993/medium-cover.jpg","large_cover_image":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/fire_on_the_amazon_1993/large-cover.jpg","state":"ok","torrents":[{"url":"https://yts.mx/torrent/download/C737CD336379DB6FC04458FC2EAF2A5C05DC9EB5","hash":"C737CD336379DB6FC04458FC2EAF2A5C05DC9EB5","quality":"720p","type":"web","is_repack":"0","video_codec":"x264","bit_depth":"8","audio_channels":"2.0","seeds":96,"peers":29,"size":"722.71 MB","size_bytes":757816361,"date_uploaded":"2024-02-02 11:19:47","date_uploaded_unix":1706869187}],"date_uploaded":"2024-02-02 11:19:47","date_uploaded_unix":1706869187},{"id":59571,"url":"https://yts.mx/movies/girl-vs-monster-2012","imdb_code":"tt2326087","title":"Girl Vs.

After the show, the Blockheads kidnap Lowbelly, so they can play the recording they have of The Clayboys' music, and have him cry more pearls so they can get rich! However, they discover that Lowbelly will only cry pearls when he hears the music live, so the two villains now intend to kidnap the band members as well!—Anthony Pereyra {hypersonic91@yahoo.com}","yt_trailer_code":"vyOCHDZxxUo","language":"en","mpa_rating":"","background_image":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/gumby_the_movie_1995/background.jpg","background_image_original":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/gumby_the_movie_1995/background.jpg","small_cover_image":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/gumby_the_movie_1995/small-cover.jpg","medium_cover_image":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/gumby_the_movie_1995/medium-cover.jpg","large_cover_image":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/gumby_the_movie_1995/large-cover.jpg","state":"ok","torrents":[{"url":"https://yts.mx/torrent/download/6EA5F4A71E0A101D0809271D5112293DD1099D7A","hash":"6EA5F4A71E0A101D0809271D5112293DD1099D7A","quality":"720p","type":"bluray","is_repack":"0","video_codec":"x264","bit_depth":"8","audio_channels":"2.0","seeds":26,"peers":2,"size":"815.19 MB","size_bytes":854788669,"date_uploaded":"2024-01-24 23:11:18","date_uploaded_unix":1706134278},{"url":"https://yts.mx/torrent/download/ED6EF6B3147E157C9C3BCD7B5439E31DA7143AAB","hash":"ED6EF6B3147E157C9C3BCD7B5439E31DA7143AAB","quality":"1080p","type":"bluray","is_repack":"0","video_codec":"x264","bit_depth":"8","audio_channels":"2.0","seeds":53,"peers":9,"size":"1.48 GB","size_bytes":1589137900,"date_uploaded":"2024-01-25 00:15:58","date_uploaded_unix":1706138158}],"date_uploaded":"2024-01-24 23:11:18","date_uploaded_unix":1706134278},{"id":59445,"url":"https://yts.mx/movies/adventure-scouts-2010","imdb_code":"tt0994917","title":"Adventure Scouts","title_english":"Adventure Scouts","title_long":"Adventure Scouts (2010)","slug":"adventure-scouts-2010","year":2010,"rating":5.5,"runtime":83,"genres":["Action","Adventure","Comedy","Family","Fantasy","Mystery","Sport"],"summary":"Scouts Honor is a coming of age movie about a group of boys and girls called \"adventure scouts\" who return from a camping trip to discover their small town is being held captive by a gang of motorcycle-riding knuckleheads.

As a result, the overprotective King Marcus and Queen Elvina forbid her from going skating ever again.Annoyed, Annika sneaks out to join a skating festival in the village that night. A powerful sorcerer named Wenlock appears and orders the princess to marry him. Marcus and Elvina arrive and confront Wenlock, but he laughs and cryptically reminds Marcus and Elvina of the fate of their \"other daughter\". When Annika refuses his proposal, Wenlock petrifies the entire village population, including Annika's parents. Annika is rescued by a winged horse named Brietta, but Wenlock warns her she has three days to marry him; otherwise, the spell will become permanent.Brietta takes Annika to the Cloud Kingdom, ruled by Queen Rayla. Annika discovers that her parents' \"other daughter\" is, in fact, Brietta, who was transformed into a pegasus by Wenlock when she refused to marry him. This explains why their parents were so protective of Annika once she was born. The Cloud Queen tells Annika that the only thing that can defeat Wenlock is a \"Wand of Light\"; built from a measure of courage, a ring of love, and a gem of ice lit by hope's eternal flame. Despite Brietta's reluctance due to past failed attempts, Annika assures her that they can build the wand together.Annika, Brietta, and Shiver travel to the Forbidden Forest, where they meet Aidan, a blacksmith. When Shiver and Annika fall into a giant's stew pot, Annika uses her hair ribbon to help them escape. The ribbon, Annika's exact height, is the \"measure of courage\", and turns into a staff for the Wand of Light. After getting a map from the gem dealer Ferris, the group finds a large cavern filled with ice gems, where Annika and Aidan take one each. Aidan reveals that he ran away from his parents after he lost all of their money gambling. He took an extra gem to bring to his parents, so they would forgive him. Brietta offers her tiara for the ring of love. With all three objects, Aidan smiths the \"Wand of Light\", and Annika uses it to transform Brietta back into a human.On their way back to the Cloud Kingdom, Annika and Brietta are pursued by Wenlock, and Brietta is knocked unconscious in the chase. Enraged, Annika orders the wand to destroy Wenlock, but it doesn't work. With no other options, she gives in and finally agrees to marry him. Wenlock refuses, calling her annoying, just like his former wives, all now cursed to become trolls. He takes the wand and buries Annika in an avalanche.Aidan helps dig Annika out. After she recuperates, the group sneaks into Wenlock's palace. Annika finds the wand, but it has been damaged and the gem breaks off and falls into the sea.

Having studied magic and sorcery, Magnifico gained the ability to grant the wishes of his subjects. When each resident turns 18, a ceremony is held where they give up their wish to Magnifico, who keeps them sealed in his observatory. Once a month, Magnifico selects one of the residents' wishes to be granted before the city.\nIn the present day, 17-year-old Asha prepares to interview for the role of Magnifico's apprentice, along with her pet goat Valentino. It is her grandfather Sabino's 100th birthday, and Asha hopes Magnifico will grant his wish in commemoration. Her best friend Dahlia, who runs the castle bakery alongside their six friends Simon, Gabo, Bazeema, Safi, Dario, and Hal, advises Asha to be honest about her weaknesses. The interview initially goes well, with Magnifico and Asha expressing a shared desire to protect the wishes of Rosas. However, when Asha requests for Sabino's wish to be granted, Magnifico refuses. A heated argument ensues, and it is revealed that Magnifico erases the memories of the citizens' wishes when they are made, and never returns the ungranted wishes to their owners. In doing so, the populace is rendered docile and free of aspirations, and thus dependent on Magnifico.\nAt the wish-granting ceremony that evening, Magnifico makes a point of not granting Sabino's wish, and dismisses Asha as his apprentice. Asha tries to tell her family the truth about Magnifico, but they do not believe her. Frustrated and out of options, Asha wishes to the heavens, and a ball of light drops from the sky, which is revealed to be a physical manifestation of the star she wished on. Unbeknownst to her, Magnifico observes Star's arrival and interprets it as a threat to Rosas. Against his wife's wishes, Magnifico searches his collection of ancient spell books for a way to counter Star's power.\nMeanwhile, Star's magic brings the forest to life, giving voices to the animals and the plants, as well as Valentino. They explain to Asha that all living things come from stardust. Asha, Valentino and Star embark on a mission to recover Sabino's wish, breaking into Magnifico's study with help from Dahlia. Magnifico puts a bounty on information relating to Star, but at a public appearance, the residents of Rosas begin questioning his rule for the first time. Agitated, Magnifico turns to dark magic to keep his power over Rosas.\nAsha returns Sabino's wish, and he is overjoyed to have his memories back. However, Magnifico bursts into the family's home, having been informed by a mole that Asha was responsible for Star's arrival. He crushes her mother Sakina's wish as punishment, causing Sakina to be overcome with grief. Star tries to defend her, but is spotted by Magnifico, who vows to capture him. Asha and her family flee with Star; Sabino and Sakina are sent to a neighboring island for safety while Asha returns to the city in pursuit of the other wishes. Magnifico reveals that Simon is the mole who exposed Asha and grants his wish of being a knight, turning him into his pawn.\nMagnifico creates an all-powerful staff by crushing more wishes. Asha rallies her friends, and they are joined by Queen Amaya as they march on Magnifico's study. Now fully corrupted, Magnifico ascends the castle's tower and saps the power of every wish in Rosas. While the animal companions battle Simon, Asha duels Magnifico, who traps Star in his staff and blacks out the stars.\nAsha, remembering that all humans come from stardust, pleads the citizens of Rosas to make a wish. They do so, and the strength of their desire overpowers Magnifico, sealing him in his staff. Star is released, and the people of Rosas are now free to pursue their wishes of their own volition.

considered by many as the greatest rock and roll film of all time.","yt_trailer_code":"ZYTpMZjZxwI","language":"en","mpa_rating":"R","background_image":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/once_were_brothers_2019/background.jpg","background_image_original":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/once_were_brothers_2019/background.jpg","small_cover_image":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/once_were_brothers_2019/small-cover.jpg","medium_cover_image":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/once_were_brothers_2019/medium-cover.jpg","large_cover_image":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/once_were_brothers_2019/large-cover.jpg","state":"ok","torrents":[{"url":"https://yts.mx/torrent/download/C497DA5B86DD4D723355CD9ABC2D4B7729612D1C","hash":"C497DA5B86DD4D723355CD9ABC2D4B7729612D1C","quality":"720p","type":"bluray","is_repack":"0","video_codec":"x264","bit_depth":"8","audio_channels":"2.0","seeds":15,"peers":0,"size":"934.87 MB","size_bytes":980282245,"date_uploaded":"2024-01-17 23:27:34","date_uploaded_unix":1705530454},{"url":"https://yts.mx/torrent/download/D8571146743BBA02C710EE0D3AE69329F63566D0","hash":"D8571146743BBA02C710EE0D3AE69329F63566D0","quality":"1080p","type":"bluray","is_repack":"0","video_codec":"x264","bit_depth":"8","audio_channels":"5.1","seeds":16,"peers":4,"size":"1.87 GB","size_bytes":2007897211,"date_uploaded":"2024-01-18 00:47:20","date_uploaded_unix":1705535240}],"date_uploaded":"2024-01-17 23:27:34","date_uploaded_unix":1705530454},{"id":59251,"url":"https://yts.mx/movies/the-boys-in-the-boat-2023","imdb_code":"tt1856080","title":"The Boys in the Boat","title_english":"The Boys in the Boat","title_long":"The Boys in the Boat (2023)","slug":"the-boys-in-the-boat-2023","year":2023,"rating":7,"runtime":123,"genres":["Biography","Drama","Sport"],"summary":"The Boys in the Boat is a sports drama based on the #1 New York Times bestselling non-fiction novel","description_full":"The Boys in the Boat is a sports drama based on the #1 New York Times bestselling non-fiction novel","synopsis":"The Boys in the Boat is a sports drama based on the #1 New York Times bestselling non-fiction novel","yt_trailer_code":"dfEA-udzjjQ","language":"en","mpa_rating":"PG-13","background_image":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/the_boys_in_the_boat_2023/background.jpg","background_image_original":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/the_boys_in_the_boat_2023/background.jpg","small_cover_image":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/the_boys_in_the_boat_2023/small-cover.jpg","medium_cover_image":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/the_boys_in_the_boat_2023/medium-cover.jpg","large_cover_image":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/the_boys_in_the_boat_2023/large-cover.jpg","state":"ok","torrents":[{"url":"https://yts.mx/torrent/download/4B8400EC23867D934D21FB55958B68C635A7BA43","hash":"4B8400EC23867D934D21FB55958B68C635A7BA43","quality":"720p","type":"web","is_repack":"0","video_codec":"x264","bit_depth":"8","audio_channels":"2.0","seeds":100,"peers":34,"size":"1.11 GB","size_bytes":1191853425,"date_uploaded":"2024-01-16 08:09:40","date_uploaded_unix":1705388980},{"url":"https://yts.mx/torrent/download/15213DAA29EF1F91B3E9EDC0A39A112A47C31BBD","hash":"15213DAA29EF1F91B3E9EDC0A39A112A47C31BBD","quality":"1080p","type":"web","is_repack":"0","video_codec":"x264","bit_depth":"8","audio_channels":"5.1","seeds":100,"peers":39,"size":"2.28 GB","size_bytes":2448131359,"date_uploaded":"2024-01-16 09:25:55","date_uploaded_unix":1705393555},{"url":"https://yts.mx/torrent/download/82A078658580FFF91B1112A807938866C9B5159C","hash":"82A078658580FFF91B1112A807938866C9B5159C","quality":"1080p","type":"web","is_repack":"0","video_codec":"x265","bit_depth":"10","audio_channels":"5.1","seeds":100,"peers":41,"size":"2.07 GB","size_bytes":2222645576,"date_uploaded":"2024-01-17 09:52:18","date_uploaded_unix":1705481538},{"url":"https://yts.mx/torrent/download/268787EAE95625BA0AEC8217F697F005E3496B23","hash":"268787EAE95625BA0AEC8217F697F005E3496B23","quality":"2160p","type":"web","is_repack":"0","video_codec":"x265","bit_depth":"10","audio_channels":"5.1","seeds":100,"peers":90,"size":"5.51 GB","size_bytes":5916317450,"date_uploaded":"2024-01-18 21:56:49","date_uploaded_unix":1705611409}],"date_uploaded":"2024-01-16 08:09:40","date_uploaded_unix":1705388980},{"id":59175,"url":"https://yts.mx/movies/el-cantante-2006","imdb_code":"tt0458522","title":"El cantante","title_english":"El cantante","title_long":"El cantante (2006)","slug":"el-cantante-2006","year":2006,"rating":5.5,"runtime":106,"genres":["Biography","Drama","Music"],"summary":"The rise and fall of salsa singer, Héctor Lavoe (1946-1993), as told from the perspective of his wife Puchi, who looks back from 2002.

Manya Surve is small street gangster who thinks he isn't a \"Ch***ya\" after a brawl with Dilawar.In 1970 Manohar Surve alias Manya Surve, is a decent student of Kirti College, Dadar. He is equally good in studies and in nature, who had just finished his exams even whilst Vidya is trying to distract him for answers. Vidya asks him why he doesn't give the answers and Manya replies that even though they are in love he will not do anything stupid to stop him being successful. Vidya understands and persuades Manya to take her to meet his parents. Whilst presenting his girlfriend Vidya Joshi (Kangna Ranaut) to his mother to discuss their marriage, Manya is interrupted by his older brother Bhargav Surve. Bhargav is a gangster who is after an underworld don named Nitesh Dhamne (Ranjeet).Soon enough, Bhargav is attacked by Bhaskar's goons, and beaten up. Manya jumps in to save him, while Manya Surve clutches one of the goons. Bhargav stabs the goon, and he dies on the spot. On the day of Manya's exam results, before he can discover his grades, Manye and his brother are arrested by Insp. Ambolkar (Raju Kher) and end up in Yerawada Prison.In prison, another convict named Munir (Tusshar Kapoor) saves Manya from being attacked by a goon named Potya, during lunch time. In this assault, Bhargav is killed. Munir befriends Manya and another convict named Veera, who trains Manya to become stronger. Manya trains and then eventually is challenged by Potya. Manya takes the lead by staying in front of Potya during the whole fight. Soon enough, Potya backfires and beats Manya up, in which response, Manya stabs Potya to his death.in 1978, the Mastan gang rules Mumbai & Afaaque is dealing with the inadequacy of law which does not allow him to tackle the brutality of the Mastan gang members who sexually assault & pillage at will. No one is willing to testify against them, & without proof Afaaque is powerless.Siddque, who is a local newspaper editor, encourages one of Afaaque's officers to use small time crooks Zubair and Dilawar to take out the Manstan gang. In exchange for police protection, a deal is made & Dilawar and Zubair become the undisputed kings of the Mumbai underworld. They help the police in arresting the 2 high ranking gang members of the Mastan gang Yasin & Batla.\nLater, both Manya and Munir escape from the prison while they were working on a railway track and try to tie hands with two brothers who rule Mumbai's deals. The first brother, Zubair Imtiaz Haksar (Manoj Bajpai) is cool, who is impressed by Manya. However, the second brother, Dilawar (Sonu Sood), disapproves of Manya and dislikes him. Due to this Zubair refuses to form an alliance with Manya & Munir.After this act Manya forms his own gang which consists of him, Munir, Veera and Gyancho, a sharpshooter, brought by Munir. They start with small time bank robberies, but gradually start eliminating local goons to take over the weekly protection money business in select Bombay localities. While trading up, he challenges Bhaskar for the control of Dadar docks & finds out that Bhaskar had sent goons to kill Bhargav when Bhargav had challenged Bhaskar many years earlier. Bhaskar also says that he got Bhargav & Manohar arrested & then killed within jail. Manya kills Bhaskar.\nManya meets up with Vidya again and starts a relationship with her.

When a case worker (Tasha Smith) visits to check up on everything, David's bed is no longer in the basement.What Abby discovers is that Eve is highly unstable. While doting on Ethan, Eve competes with Abby for his love, and develops a spiteful and increasingly violent relationship with Abby as Abby grows more and more rebellious because of her suspicions of Eve and Raymond.The violence starts with Eve slapping Abby for using a four letter word against her.

Abby realizes that she and Ethan have to save themselves from Eve before she can kill them.Abby gets Ethan, who is still sick, outside of the house and inside of a car, and then Abby sees Raymond returning home.

It's Ben, who immediately hangs up.Ben, who is just down the hill from the house, has started suspecting Eve and Raymond of child endangerment, so he called to make sure they're home. Ben alerts his colleagues at the LAPD. Over the house's intercom, Eve tells Abby that she's not going anywhere.Abby goes out to the garage, and starts up the SUV, but she gets out of it so she can open the garage door.

Ruffly 17 years? Or did it pop back in your head just now looking at the song's name after years of blissful silence? Either way, the hook has got staying power. A power that dates back to as early as 1959 and possibly before.Answering the age old question of who exactly let the dogs out is more complicated than anyone ever thought. Fortunately, Ben Sisto has dedicated seven years to exploring and exposing a story steeped in show business, legal battles, female empowerment, artistic integrity and one very catchy hook.Sisto, a marketer and cultural programmer for the Ace Hotel in New York, first fell down the rabbit hole in 2010 when he learned it was \"Who Let The Dogs Out\"'s 10 year anniversary. At the time, its Wikipedia page gave a simple, uncited explanation that the original song was recorded off a parade float by a hairdresser named Keith.Unemployed at the time, Sisto made his mission of the day to fix that citation. Now, almost a decade later, Sisto has finally pieced together the song's origin...The documentary 'Who Let The Dogs Out' follows an Inconvenient Truth/Ted Talk style presentation that Sisto does across North America. It's a live talk that explains the story of 'Who Let The Dogs Out' and is accompanied by a museum of over 250 LPs, CD, tapes, magazines, shirts, toys and other ephemera related to the song. The collection is home to objects from the US, UK, Australia, Brazil, Germany, Japan and various other places, acquired over a period of approximately 7 years.Between the live talk segments, we follow Ben on the dog journey from the Baha Men in Trinidad and Tobago, meeting Steve Greenberg, the New York based pop hit producer of the song (also classics like Hanson's Mmmbop) and even to hairdresser Keith in London, all in the hopes of finding out the truth.Sisto was able to create the thesis to his life's work - the idea that everything is based on prior art, and everything is source material for future art.It's from this mantra that the dogs were let out.. and we are here to explore who did it.","description_full":"How many years has 'Who Let The Dogs Out' been stuck in your head?

A powerful sorcerer named Wenlock appears and orders the princess to marry him. Marcus and Elvina arrive and confront Wenlock, but he laughs and cryptically reminds Marcus and Elvina of the fate of their \"other daughter\". When Annika refuses his proposal, Wenlock petrifies the entire village population, including Annika's parents. Annika is rescued by a winged horse named Brietta, but Wenlock warns her she has three days to marry him; otherwise, the spell will become permanent.Brietta takes Annika to the Cloud Kingdom, ruled by Queen Rayla. Annika discovers that her parents' \"other daughter\" is, in fact, Brietta, who was transformed into a pegasus by Wenlock when she refused to marry him. This explains why their parents were so protective of Annika once she was born. The Cloud Queen tells Annika that the only thing that can defeat Wenlock is a \"Wand of Light\"; built from a measure of courage, a ring of love, and a gem of ice lit by hope's eternal flame. Despite Brietta's reluctance due to past failed attempts, Annika assures her that they can build the wand together.Annika, Brietta, and Shiver travel to the Forbidden Forest, where they meet Aidan, a blacksmith. When Shiver and Annika fall into a giant's stew pot, Annika uses her hair ribbon to help them escape. The ribbon, Annika's exact height, is the \"measure of courage\", and turns into a staff for the Wand of Light. After getting a map from the gem dealer Ferris, the group finds a large cavern filled with ice gems, where Annika and Aidan take one each. Aidan reveals that he ran away from his parents after he lost all of their money gambling. He took an extra gem to bring to his parents, so they would forgive him. Brietta offers her tiara for the ring of love. With all three objects, Aidan smiths the \"Wand of Light\", and Annika uses it to transform Brietta back into a human.On their way back to the Cloud Kingdom, Annika and Brietta are pursued by Wenlock, and Brietta is knocked unconscious in the chase. Enraged, Annika orders the wand to destroy Wenlock, but it doesn't work. With no other options, she gives in and finally agrees to marry him. Wenlock refuses, calling her annoying, just like his former wives, all now cursed to become trolls. He takes the wand and buries Annika in an avalanche.Aidan helps dig Annika out. After she recuperates, the group sneaks into Wenlock's palace. Annika finds the wand, but it has been damaged and the gem breaks off and falls into the sea. Aidan offers his gem as a replacement; realizing that the wand cannot be used for vengeance, Annika breaks all of Wenlock's spells for the love of her family and her people. Wenlock is stripped of his powers, his ex-wives are restored to their true forms, and the spell on Annika's kingdom is broken.

Having studied magic and sorcery, Magnifico gained the ability to grant the wishes of his subjects. When each resident turns 18, a ceremony is held where they give up their wish to Magnifico, who keeps them sealed in his observatory. Once a month, Magnifico selects one of the residents' wishes to be granted before the city.\nIn the present day, 17-year-old Asha prepares to interview for the role of Magnifico's apprentice, along with her pet goat Valentino. It is her grandfather Sabino's 100th birthday, and Asha hopes Magnifico will grant his wish in commemoration. Her best friend Dahlia, who runs the castle bakery alongside their six friends Simon, Gabo, Bazeema, Safi, Dario, and Hal, advises Asha to be honest about her weaknesses. The interview initially goes well, with Magnifico and Asha expressing a shared desire to protect the wishes of Rosas. However, when Asha requests for Sabino's wish to be granted, Magnifico refuses. A heated argument ensues, and it is revealed that Magnifico erases the memories of the citizens' wishes when they are made, and never returns the ungranted wishes to their owners. In doing so, the populace is rendered docile and free of aspirations, and thus dependent on Magnifico.\nAt the wish-granting ceremony that evening, Magnifico makes a point of not granting Sabino's wish, and dismisses Asha as his apprentice. Asha tries to tell her family the truth about Magnifico, but they do not believe her. Frustrated and out of options, Asha wishes to the heavens, and a ball of light drops from the sky, which is revealed to be a physical manifestation of the star she wished on. Unbeknownst to her, Magnifico observes Star's arrival and interprets it as a threat to Rosas. Against his wife's wishes, Magnifico searches his collection of ancient spell books for a way to counter Star's power.\nMeanwhile, Star's magic brings the forest to life, giving voices to the animals and the plants, as well as Valentino. They explain to Asha that all living things come from stardust. Asha, Valentino and Star embark on a mission to recover Sabino's wish, breaking into Magnifico's study with help from Dahlia. Magnifico puts a bounty on information relating to Star, but at a public appearance, the residents of Rosas begin questioning his rule for the first time. Agitated, Magnifico turns to dark magic to keep his power over Rosas.\nAsha returns Sabino's wish, and he is overjoyed to have his memories back. However, Magnifico bursts into the family's home, having been informed by a mole that Asha was responsible for Star's arrival. He crushes her mother Sakina's wish as punishment, causing Sakina to be overcome with grief. Star tries to defend her, but is spotted by Magnifico, who vows to capture him. Asha and her family flee with Star; Sabino and Sakina are sent to a neighboring island for safety while Asha returns to the city in pursuit of the other wishes. Magnifico reveals that Simon is the mole who exposed Asha and grants his wish of being a knight, turning him into his pawn.\nMagnifico creates an all-powerful staff by crushing more wishes. Asha rallies her friends, and they are joined by Queen Amaya as they march on Magnifico's study. Now fully corrupted, Magnifico ascends the castle's tower and saps the power of every wish in Rosas. While the animal companions battle Simon, Asha duels Magnifico, who traps Star in his staff and blacks out the stars.\nAsha, remembering that all humans come from stardust, pleads the citizens of Rosas to make a wish.

Willy then goes to look at a store he plans to buy. That evening, Willy gets everything out and plans to sleep on a park bench, until a dog called \"Tiddles\" comes and sniffs his leg and a man tells him to come and spend the night in his sanctuary.Once inside Scrubit and Bleachers sanctuary, Willy heads for the fireplace to warm up. Mrs Scrubit then shows Willy a contract to sign, and a girl who works there called Noodle tells him to read the contract carefully, but Willy just instantly signs. Mrs Scrubit then tells Noodle off and throws her in a coup. The next day, Willy heads back to the Gourmet store and tells the public about his new flying chocolates and a trio of Chocolatiers see this and call the police, before going out and tasting some. After negatively criticizing Willy, the three start floating around and the police arrive. Willy asks the Chief of police for some money for his rent and he hands him a silver coin. Unfortunately however, Willy didn't read the contract properly and that coin wouldn't be enough and Mrs Scrubit tells Willy he will have to work off the rest of the debt. Willy then goes down the laundry Shute and meets a bunch of other people who suffered similar fates to him.That night, Noodle came into Willys room and tells him she has never tasted chocolate, so Willy makes her a chocolate treat, using his chocolate making machine and tells her the story of his childhood. His mother used to make great chocolate and they had planned to take over the store in the Gourmet store that Willy wanted, but she had died soon after and he had never found out her secret. Noodle takes a bite of the chocolate and enjoys it, but is saddened by the fact that she won't be able to have more, so Willy offers her a lifetime supply of chocolate and Noodle tells Willy one way they can escape. Meanwhile, underneath the cathedral, the Chief of police is meeting with the Chocolatiers and through a song, encourage him to eliminate the competition and get rid of Wonka, by offering him 1,000 boxes of chocolate and he agrees.The next morning, Willy and Noodle attempt to get Scrubit and Bleacher to fall in love and Willy goes back down the Shute, and reveals an invention, which will do everyone's work for them and he and Noodle escape. Now on the streets, Willy tells Noodle about a \"little orange man with green hair\" who keeps stealing his chocolates, but Noodle doesn't believe him. Then Willy says that he needs to make more chocolate and he needs the milk from a giraffe to make it. At the zoo, they knock out the security guard by giving him a chocolate that goes through all sorts of alcoholic beverages and the two sneak in. Once inside the zoo, it is revealed that Willy cannot read as he opens the door to the tiger instead of the giraffe. Noodle opens the door to the giraffe and whilst Willy milks the giraffe Noodle tells him that her name isn't really Noodle, only assumed to be, when Scrubit found her in a basket, with an \"N\" on her necklace. On the way out of the zoo, Willy grabs hold of some balloons and floats to the roof of the Gourmet store, where he and Noodle sing and dance, but the police see them. The Chief of police has a conversation with Willy and the two sneak back into the workshop.One of them tells the story of how the Trio have been in cahoots for a long time and he used to work for one (Slugworth), but got fired for snooping around and Willy tells them he is a chocolate maker and his dream of owning the store. That night, Willy passes Noodle her chocolates and the gang have a conversation and agree to help Willy with his dream.The following day, Willy tries out all sorts of new delicious confectionery on the members of the public and the police follow him on bicycles. Eventually, the Chief of police finds a chocolate wrapper and figures out that he has been escaping through the drains in the road. That night, the Chief of police asks the Chocolatiers for more chocolate and they agree. Meanwhile in Willys room, the little orange man comes back, but gets caught in a trap Willy had set and wakes him up. The man tells Willy that he is an Oompa Loompa and he is disappointed at Willy for stealing cocoa beans from Loompaland Land and that he won't go away until he has all the chocolate he requires, before hitting Willy with a frying pan and escaping with the chocolate.The next day, the friends showed Willy the keys to the store and open it up. At first it was a bit of a dump, but they soon got it all up to scratch. The grand opening went really well, until it is revealed that someone had sabotaged the treats and the customers all riot, burning down the store. The others leave Willy alone in the rubble and the three Chocolatiers arrive with a brief case full of money, which they will give to his friends, if he leaves town for good and Willy agrees. Later that evening, Willy arrives at the docks, shakes Slugworth's hand and sets sail. Also on board was the Oompa Loompa and he tells Willy he won't leave him alone until he gets the chocolate and Willy notices an \"A\" mark on his hand and realizes that Noodle is in great danger. Willy and the Oompa Loompa go to see the captain, but see dynamite strapped to the wheel instead. The duo jump off and the Chocolatiers just stand and laugh as the boat explodes. Slugworth then goes to give Scrubit the money.The next morning, Mrs Scrubit and Mr Bleacher let everyone go with their money, but tells Noodle that her money was to keep her there and Mrs Scrubit grabs her and throws her in the coup again. Suddenly, Willy appears and tells Noodle that they are going to go and steal the ledger and break Noodle free from the coup. At the cathedral, Noodle is disguised as a nun and asks the father for some chocolate, but he refuses. Willy and a couple others go to the zoo, steal the giraffe and let it loose in the cathedral. The father phones the \"zoo\", which is Willy and his friends on the other side of the phone and tells them to get rid of it. They do so, just before the Baron's funeral. After hearing what had happened, Slugworth calls the father and rushes to the cathedral. Meanwhile, Willy and Noodle had entered underneath the cathedral and started searching for the book. Finally, Noodle opened a trap door in the wall and got out the book. Unfortunately, Slugworth and his companions got them and throw them in a giant chocolate mixer. Slugworth then tells them that the \"N\" is actually a \"Z\", which belonged to his brother \"Zebbedy\" and told Noodle that he told her mother she would be in good hands, but instead, threw her down the laundry Shute and told her mother that she had died, before locking the door, taking Willys chocolates for the Oompa Loompa, eating them and leaving Willy and Noodle to drown in a river of chocolate. Noodle however, had a plan to let the chocolate lift them and they could bang on the glass. Unfortunately, no one would help them and the two went under.Fortunately, the Oompa Loompa came to the rescue and the duo got out with the book. The now oversized Chief of police got out of the car and is told that he as well as the Chocolatiers are under arrest. The Chocolatiers then start floating again and Willy reveals that the chocolate they had eaten were actually the flying chocolates from earlier on. Slugworth claims they'll be back before floating away.Willy then finally finds out his mother's secret that it's the people you share the chocolate with that matters, not the chocolate itself. Willy shares a piece with everyone, before telling Noodle that her mother lives at the local library and the two get reacquainted and Willy shows the Oompa Loompa an old castle, which he plans to make into a factory and the Oompa Loompa becomes Chief chocolate taster.As the credits roll, the Oompa Loompa reveals what happened to everyone, including Scrubit and Bleacher, who were under arrest, but tried to get out of it by eating the poisoned chocolates and the two have one last kiss.","description_full":"A ship sails towards land and a young Willy Wonka stands on top of a mast, singing a song and when the ship ports in dock, Willy continues singing, but gives away all but 1 of his silver coins, the last of which he drops down a drain.

At the zoo, they knock out the security guard by giving him a chocolate that goes through all sorts of alcoholic beverages and the two sneak in. Once inside the zoo, it is revealed that Willy cannot read as he opens the door to the tiger instead of the giraffe. Noodle opens the door to the giraffe and whilst Willy milks the giraffe Noodle tells him that her name isn't really Noodle, only assumed to be, when Scrubit found her in a basket, with an \"N\" on her necklace. On the way out of the zoo, Willy grabs hold of some balloons and floats to the roof of the Gourmet store, where he and Noodle sing and dance, but the police see them. The Chief of police has a conversation with Willy and the two sneak back into the workshop.One of them tells the story of how the Trio have been in cahoots for a long time and he used to work for one (Slugworth), but got fired for snooping around and Willy tells them he is a chocolate maker and his dream of owning the store. That night, Willy passes Noodle her chocolates and the gang have a conversation and agree to help Willy with his dream.The following day, Willy tries out all sorts of new delicious confectionery on the members of the public and the police follow him on bicycles. Eventually, the Chief of police finds a chocolate wrapper and figures out that he has been escaping through the drains in the road. That night, the Chief of police asks the Chocolatiers for more chocolate and they agree. Meanwhile in Willys room, the little orange man comes back, but gets caught in a trap Willy had set and wakes him up. The man tells Willy that he is an Oompa Loompa and he is disappointed at Willy for stealing cocoa beans from Loompaland Land and that he won't go away until he has all the chocolate he requires, before hitting Willy with a frying pan and escaping with the chocolate.The next day, the friends showed Willy the keys to the store and open it up. At first it was a bit of a dump, but they soon got it all up to scratch. The grand opening went really well, until it is revealed that someone had sabotaged the treats and the customers all riot, burning down the store. The others leave Willy alone in the rubble and the three Chocolatiers arrive with a brief case full of money, which they will give to his friends, if he leaves town for good and Willy agrees. Later that evening, Willy arrives at the docks, shakes Slugworth's hand and sets sail. Also on board was the Oompa Loompa and he tells Willy he won't leave him alone until he gets the chocolate and Willy notices an \"A\" mark on his hand and realizes that Noodle is in great danger. Willy and the Oompa Loompa go to see the captain, but see dynamite strapped to the wheel instead. The duo jump off and the Chocolatiers just stand and laugh as the boat explodes. Slugworth then goes to give Scrubit the money.The next morning, Mrs Scrubit and Mr Bleacher let everyone go with their money, but tells Noodle that her money was to keep her there and Mrs Scrubit grabs her and throws her in the coup again. Suddenly, Willy appears and tells Noodle that they are going to go and steal the ledger and break Noodle free from the coup. At the cathedral, Noodle is disguised as a nun and asks the father for some chocolate, but he refuses. Willy and a couple others go to the zoo, steal the giraffe and let it loose in the cathedral. The father phones the \"zoo\", which is Willy and his friends on the other side of the phone and tells them to get rid of it. They do so, just before the Baron's funeral. After hearing what had happened, Slugworth calls the father and rushes to the cathedral. Meanwhile, Willy and Noodle had entered underneath the cathedral and started searching for the book. Finally, Noodle opened a trap door in the wall and got out the book. Unfortunately, Slugworth and his companions got them and throw them in a giant chocolate mixer. Slugworth then tells them that the \"N\" is actually a \"Z\", which belonged to his brother \"Zebbedy\" and told Noodle that he told her mother she would be in good hands, but instead, threw her down the laundry Shute and told her mother that she had died, before locking the door, taking Willys chocolates for the Oompa Loompa, eating them and leaving Willy and Noodle to drown in a river of chocolate. Noodle however, had a plan to let the chocolate lift them and they could bang on the glass. Unfortunately, no one would help them and the two went under.Fortunately, the Oompa Loompa came to the rescue and the duo got out with the book. The now oversized Chief of police got out of the car and is told that he as well as the Chocolatiers are under arrest. The Chocolatiers then start floating again and Willy reveals that the chocolate they had eaten were actually the flying chocolates from earlier on. Slugworth claims they'll be back before floating away.Willy then finally finds out his mother's secret that it's the people you share the chocolate with that matters, not the chocolate itself. Willy shares a piece with everyone, before telling Noodle that her mother lives at the local library and the two get reacquainted and Willy shows the Oompa Loompa an old castle, which he plans to make into a factory and the Oompa Loompa becomes Chief chocolate taster.As the credits roll, the Oompa Loompa reveals what happened to everyone, including Scrubit and Bleacher, who were under arrest, but tried to get out of it by eating the poisoned chocolates and the two have one last kiss.","yt_trailer_code":"wYmtRhKvmVE","language":"en","mpa_rating":"PG","background_image":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/wonka_2023/background.jpg","background_image_original":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/wonka_2023/background.jpg","small_cover_image":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/wonka_2023/small-cover.jpg","medium_cover_image":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/wonka_2023/medium-cover.jpg","large_cover_image":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/wonka_2023/large-cover.jpg","state":"ok","torrents":[{"url":"https://yts.mx/torrent/download/F53F7342CA4416CA47055C26148D5593466CEBFE","hash":"F53F7342CA4416CA47055C26148D5593466CEBFE","quality":"720p","type":"web","is_repack":"0","video_codec":"x264","bit_depth":"8","audio_channels":"2.0","seeds":100,"peers":100,"size":"1.05 GB","size_bytes":1127428915,"date_uploaded":"2024-01-20 02:23:17","date_uploaded_unix":1705713797},{"url":"https://yts.mx/torrent/download/0DCDCE72274C180827B47D4352F501367607A55F","hash":"0DCDCE72274C180827B47D4352F501367607A55F","quality":"1080p","type":"web","is_repack":"0","video_codec":"x264","bit_depth":"8","audio_channels":"5.1","seeds":100,"peers":100,"size":"2.15 GB","size_bytes":2308544922,"date_uploaded":"2024-01-20 03:32:34","date_uploaded_unix":1705717954},{"url":"https://yts.mx/torrent/download/775DA244F569D6614C44094899D223E3934CE1C2","hash":"775DA244F569D6614C44094899D223E3934CE1C2","quality":"1080p","type":"web","is_repack":"0","video_codec":"x265","bit_depth":"10","audio_channels":"5.1","seeds":100,"peers":100,"size":"1.95 GB","size_bytes":2093796557,"date_uploaded":"2024-01-20 14:57:03","date_uploaded_unix":1705759023},{"url":"https://yts.mx/torrent/download/1EF41953D3D053692C828C5957FDA3619638086E","hash":"1EF41953D3D053692C828C5957FDA3619638086E","quality":"2160p","type":"web","is_repack":"0","video_codec":"x265","bit_depth":"10","audio_channels":"5.1","seeds":100,"peers":100,"size":"5.19 GB","size_bytes":5572720067,"date_uploaded":"2024-01-21 23:42:20","date_uploaded_unix":1705876940}],"date_uploaded":"2024-01-20 02:23:17","date_uploaded_unix":1705713797},{"id":59364,"url":"https://yts.mx/movies/journey-back-to-christmas-2016","imdb_code":"tt6269192","title":"Journey Back to Christmas","title_english":"Journey Back to Christmas","title_long":"Journey Back to Christmas (2016)","slug":"journey-back-to-christmas-2016","year":2016,"rating":7,"runtime":84,"genres":["Drama","Family","Fantasy","Romance","Sci-Fi"],"summary":"","description_full":"","synopsis":"","yt_trailer_code":"FPQT7I9wAeU","language":"en","mpa_rating":"","background_image":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/journey_back_to_christmas_2016/background.jpg","background_image_original":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/journey_back_to_christmas_2016/background.jpg","small_cover_image":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/journey_back_to_christmas_2016/small-cover.jpg","medium_cover_image":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/journey_back_to_christmas_2016/medium-cover.jpg","large_cover_image":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/journey_back_to_christmas_2016/large-cover.jpg","state":"ok","torrents":[{"url":"https://yts.mx/torrent/download/4FC8EC51D49D37B98BA04E561A741EB6F7F9C87C","hash":"4FC8EC51D49D37B98BA04E561A741EB6F7F9C87C","quality":"720p","type":"web","is_repack":"0","video_codec":"x264","bit_depth":"8","audio_channels":"2.0","seeds":13,"peers":4,"size":"772.1 MB","size_bytes":809605530,"date_uploaded":"2024-01-20 02:44:08","date_uploaded_unix":1705715048},{"url":"https://yts.mx/torrent/download/01F78803ED39B3F650632011EEF35F3F2C192F6A","hash":"01F78803ED39B3F650632011EEF35F3F2C192F6A","quality":"1080p","type":"web","is_repack":"0","video_codec":"x264","bit_depth":"8","audio_channels":"2.0","seeds":27,"peers":2,"size":"1.4 GB","size_bytes":1503238554,"date_uploaded":"2024-01-20 03:52:24","date_uploaded_unix":1705719144}],"date_uploaded":"2024-01-20 02:44:08","date_uploaded_unix":1705715048},{"id":59355,"url":"https://yts.mx/movies/how-to-build-a-better-boy-2014","imdb_code":"tt3098874","title":"How to Build a Better Boy","title_english":"How to Build a Better Boy","title_long":"How to Build a Better Boy (2014)","slug":"how-to-build-a-better-boy-2014","year":2014,"rating":5.3,"runtime":90,"genres":["Comedy","Family","Sci-Fi"],"summary":"Follows high school sophomores Mae Hartley and Gabby Harrison, two tech-savvy best friends who devise a plan to create the perfect boyfriend with just a few strokes of the keyboard and a wireless connection.

Willy then goes to look at a store he plans to buy. That evening, Willy gets everything out and plans to sleep on a park bench, until a dog called \"Tiddles\" comes and sniffs his leg and a man tells him to come and spend the night in his sanctuary.Once inside Scrubit and Bleachers sanctuary, Willy heads for the fireplace to warm up. Mrs Scrubit then shows Willy a contract to sign, and a girl who works there called Noodle tells him to read the contract carefully, but Willy just instantly signs. Mrs Scrubit then tells Noodle off and throws her in a coup. The next day, Willy heads back to the Gourmet store and tells the public about his new flying chocolates and a trio of Chocolatiers see this and call the police, before going out and tasting some. After negatively criticizing Willy, the three start floating around and the police arrive. Willy asks the Chief of police for some money for his rent and he hands him a silver coin. Unfortunately however, Willy didn't read the contract properly and that coin wouldn't be enough and Mrs Scrubit tells Willy he will have to work off the rest of the debt. Willy then goes down the laundry Shute and meets a bunch of other people who suffered similar fates to him.That night, Noodle came into Willys room and tells him she has never tasted chocolate, so Willy makes her a chocolate treat, using his chocolate making machine and tells her the story of his childhood. His mother used to make great chocolate and they had planned to take over the store in the Gourmet store that Willy wanted, but she had died soon after and he had never found out her secret. Noodle takes a bite of the chocolate and enjoys it, but is saddened by the fact that she won't be able to have more, so Willy offers her a lifetime supply of chocolate and Noodle tells Willy one way they can escape. Meanwhile, underneath the cathedral, the Chief of police is meeting with the Chocolatiers and through a song, encourage him to eliminate the competition and get rid of Wonka, by offering him 1,000 boxes of chocolate and he agrees.The next morning, Willy and Noodle attempt to get Scrubit and Bleacher to fall in love and Willy goes back down the Shute, and reveals an invention, which will do everyone's work for them and he and Noodle escape. Now on the streets, Willy tells Noodle about a \"little orange man with green hair\" who keeps stealing his chocolates, but Noodle doesn't believe him. Then Willy says that he needs to make more chocolate and he needs the milk from a giraffe to make it. At the zoo, they knock out the security guard by giving him a chocolate that goes through all sorts of alcoholic beverages and the two sneak in. Once inside the zoo, it is revealed that Willy cannot read as he opens the door to the tiger instead of the giraffe. Noodle opens the door to the giraffe and whilst Willy milks the giraffe Noodle tells him that her name isn't really Noodle, only assumed to be, when Scrubit found her in a basket, with an \"N\" on her necklace. On the way out of the zoo, Willy grabs hold of some balloons and floats to the roof of the Gourmet store, where he and Noodle sing and dance, but the police see them. The Chief of police has a conversation with Willy and the two sneak back into the workshop.One of them tells the story of how the Trio have been in cahoots for a long time and he used to work for one (Slugworth), but got fired for snooping around and Willy tells them he is a chocolate maker and his dream of owning the store. That night, Willy passes Noodle her chocolates and the gang have a conversation and agree to help Willy with his dream.The following day, Willy tries out all sorts of new delicious confectionery on the members of the public and the police follow him on bicycles. Eventually, the Chief of police finds a chocolate wrapper and figures out that he has been escaping through the drains in the road. That night, the Chief of police asks the Chocolatiers for more chocolate and they agree. Meanwhile in Willys room, the little orange man comes back, but gets caught in a trap Willy had set and wakes him up. The man tells Willy that he is an Oompa Loompa and he is disappointed at Willy for stealing cocoa beans from Loompaland Land and that he won't go away until he has all the chocolate he requires, before hitting Willy with a frying pan and escaping with the chocolate.The next day, the friends showed Willy the keys to the store and open it up. At first it was a bit of a dump, but they soon got it all up to scratch. The grand opening went really well, until it is revealed that someone had sabotaged the treats and the customers all riot, burning down the store. The others leave Willy alone in the rubble and the three Chocolatiers arrive with a brief case full of money, which they will give to his friends, if he leaves town for good and Willy agrees. Later that evening, Willy arrives at the docks, shakes Slugworth's hand and sets sail. Also on board was the Oompa Loompa and he tells Willy he won't leave him alone until he gets the chocolate and Willy notices an \"A\" mark on his hand and realizes that Noodle is in great danger. Willy and the Oompa Loompa go to see the captain, but see dynamite strapped to the wheel instead. The duo jump off and the Chocolatiers just stand and laugh as the boat explodes. Slugworth then goes to give Scrubit the money.The next morning, Mrs Scrubit and Mr Bleacher let everyone go with their money, but tells Noodle that her money was to keep her there and Mrs Scrubit grabs her and throws her in the coup again. Suddenly, Willy appears and tells Noodle that they are going to go and steal the ledger and break Noodle free from the coup. At the cathedral, Noodle is disguised as a nun and asks the father for some chocolate, but he refuses. Willy and a couple others go to the zoo, steal the giraffe and let it loose in the cathedral. The father phones the \"zoo\", which is Willy and his friends on the other side of the phone and tells them to get rid of it. They do so, just before the Baron's funeral. After hearing what had happened, Slugworth calls the father and rushes to the cathedral. Meanwhile, Willy and Noodle had entered underneath the cathedral and started searching for the book. Finally, Noodle opened a trap door in the wall and got out the book. Unfortunately, Slugworth and his companions got them and throw them in a giant chocolate mixer. Slugworth then tells them that the \"N\" is actually a \"Z\", which belonged to his brother \"Zebbedy\" and told Noodle that he told her mother she would be in good hands, but instead, threw her down the laundry Shute and told her mother that she had died, before locking the door, taking Willys chocolates for the Oompa Loompa, eating them and leaving Willy and Noodle to drown in a river of chocolate. Noodle however, had a plan to let the chocolate lift them and they could bang on the glass. Unfortunately, no one would help them and the two went under.Fortunately, the Oompa Loompa came to the rescue and the duo got out with the book. The now oversized Chief of police got out of the car and is told that he as well as the Chocolatiers are under arrest. The Chocolatiers then start floating again and Willy reveals that the chocolate they had eaten were actually the flying chocolates from earlier on. Slugworth claims they'll be back before floating away.Willy then finally finds out his mother's secret that it's the people you share the chocolate with that matters, not the chocolate itself. Willy shares a piece with everyone, before telling Noodle that her mother lives at the local library and the two get reacquainted and Willy shows the Oompa Loompa an old castle, which he plans to make into a factory and the Oompa Loompa becomes Chief chocolate taster.As the credits roll, the Oompa Loompa reveals what happened to everyone, including Scrubit and Bleacher, who were under arrest, but tried to get out of it by eating the poisoned chocolates and the two have one last kiss.","description_full":"A ship sails towards land and a young Willy Wonka stands on top of a mast, singing a song and when the ship ports in dock, Willy continues singing, but gives away all but 1 of his silver coins, the last of which he drops down a drain. Willy then goes to look at a store he plans to buy. That evening, Willy gets everything out and plans to sleep on a park bench, until a dog called \"Tiddles\" comes and sniffs his leg and a man tells him to come and spend the night in his sanctuary.Once inside Scrubit and Bleachers sanctuary, Willy heads for the fireplace to warm up. Mrs Scrubit then shows Willy a contract to sign, and a girl who works there called Noodle tells him to read the contract carefully, but Willy just instantly signs. Mrs Scrubit then tells Noodle off and throws her in a coup. The next day, Willy heads back to the Gourmet store and tells the public about his new flying chocolates and a trio of Chocolatiers see this and call the police, before going out and tasting some. After negatively criticizing Willy, the three start floating around and the police arrive. Willy asks the Chief of police for some money for his rent and he hands him a silver coin. Unfortunately however, Willy didn't read the contract properly and that coin wouldn't be enough and Mrs Scrubit tells Willy he will have to work off the rest of the debt. Willy then goes down the laundry Shute and meets a bunch of other people who suffered similar fates to him.That night, Noodle came into Willys room and tells him she has never tasted chocolate, so Willy makes her a chocolate treat, using his chocolate making machine and tells her the story of his childhood. His mother used to make great chocolate and they had planned to take over the store in the Gourmet store that Willy wanted, but she had died soon after and he had never found out her secret. Noodle takes a bite of the chocolate and enjoys it, but is saddened by the fact that she won't be able to have more, so Willy offers her a lifetime supply of chocolate and Noodle tells Willy one way they can escape. Meanwhile, underneath the cathedral, the Chief of police is meeting with the Chocolatiers and through a song, encourage him to eliminate the competition and get rid of Wonka, by offering him 1,000 boxes of chocolate and he agrees.The next morning, Willy and Noodle attempt to get Scrubit and Bleacher to fall in love and Willy goes back down the Shute, and reveals an invention, which will do everyone's work for them and he and Noodle escape. Now on the streets, Willy tells Noodle about a \"little orange man with green hair\" who keeps stealing his chocolates, but Noodle doesn't believe him. Then Willy says that he needs to make more chocolate and he needs the milk from a giraffe to make it. At the zoo, they knock out the security guard by giving him a chocolate that goes through all sorts of alcoholic beverages and the two sneak in. Once inside the zoo, it is revealed that Willy cannot read as he opens the door to the tiger instead of the giraffe. Noodle opens the door to the giraffe and whilst Willy milks the giraffe Noodle tells him that her name isn't really Noodle, only assumed to be, when Scrubit found her in a basket, with an \"N\" on her necklace. On the way out of the zoo, Willy grabs hold of some balloons and floats to the roof of the Gourmet store, where he and Noodle sing and dance, but the police see them. The Chief of police has a conversation with Willy and the two sneak back into the workshop.One of them tells the story of how the Trio have been in cahoots for a long time and he used to work for one (Slugworth), but got fired for snooping around and Willy tells them he is a chocolate maker and his dream of owning the store. That night, Willy passes Noodle her chocolates and the gang have a conversation and agree to help Willy with his dream.The following day, Willy tries out all sorts of new delicious confectionery on the members of the public and the police follow him on bicycles. Eventually, the Chief of police finds a chocolate wrapper and figures out that he has been escaping through the drains in the road. That night, the Chief of police asks the Chocolatiers for more chocolate and they agree. Meanwhile in Willys room, the little orange man comes back, but gets caught in a trap Willy had set and wakes him up. The man tells Willy that he is an Oompa Loompa and he is disappointed at Willy for stealing cocoa beans from Loompaland Land and that he won't go away until he has all the chocolate he requires, before hitting Willy with a frying pan and escaping with the chocolate.The next day, the friends showed Willy the keys to the store and open it up. At first it was a bit of a dump, but they soon got it all up to scratch. The grand opening went really well, until it is revealed that someone had sabotaged the treats and the customers all riot, burning down the store. The others leave Willy alone in the rubble and the three Chocolatiers arrive with a brief case full of money, which they will give to his friends, if he leaves town for good and Willy agrees. Later that evening, Willy arrives at the docks, shakes Slugworth's hand and sets sail. Also on board was the Oompa Loompa and he tells Willy he won't leave him alone until he gets the chocolate and Willy notices an \"A\" mark on his hand and realizes that Noodle is in great danger. Willy and the Oompa Loompa go to see the captain, but see dynamite strapped to the wheel instead. The duo jump off and the Chocolatiers just stand and laugh as the boat explodes. Slugworth then goes to give Scrubit the money.The next morning, Mrs Scrubit and Mr Bleacher let everyone go with their money, but tells Noodle that her money was to keep her there and Mrs Scrubit grabs her and throws her in the coup again.

The boy is asleep in his bed. Frankie stays in the bedroom after he realizes that the boy's PARENTS are awake in the next room. When Frankie opens a music box and music plays, Mike awakens and screams. Mike's mother LISA rushes into the room and finds Frankie trying to suffocate the boy with a pillow. She grabs at Frankie who whips her in the face with a rope. Mike's FATHER bursts into the room and struggles with Frankie. When the burglar brandishes a knife, Mike's Father hurls a solid glass snow globe at Frankie and hits him in the head. The burglar collapses.Later at the police station, police detective LT. MARTIN takes a statement from Mike's Father, who is the REVEREND DAVID COLLINS. When Martin reveals that Frankie died from the blow to the head, the Reverend is stunned. Lurking in the background is Frankie's father SIMMONS, a chain smoking, poverty stricken tailor with a limp. Outside the station, it is a media circus. The press hails the Reverend as a hero. The Reverend goes home to find a TV crew set up in his son's room. They are eager to reenact the crime. The Reverend orders them out of his house, Lisa's eyes were injured in the attack and she has been confined to bed with both of her eyes bandaged. Meanwhile, Simmons sees a news report comparing his dead son, a habitual criminal, with the Reverend's angelic little boy. Simmons stares hard at the picture of Mike and an idea forms in his head.That night, the Reverend feels guilt over Frankie's death. Mike can't sleep, he is afraid someone is watching him. The Reverend lets Mike sleep with him. The boy says he is praying to be brave and strong just like his father. Lurking outside the house is Simmons. Days later, the Reverend goes to Simmons' shop in the hopes of somehow consoling the man. However, the LANDLADY says Simmons has been missing for days and reports that he owes three months back rent. She also says Frankie was a \"born murderer.\" Meanwhile, Mike and his friends wander down to the old wharf. Mike climbs aboard a derelict paddle boat. Simmons follows the boy onto the boat and corners him. Mike is terrified. Just then a WATCHMAN appears and Simmons flees.That night at dinner, Mike insists that Simmons cornered him and intended to murder him. Lisa is fearful but the Reverend thinks Mike is telling a tall tale because the boy was forbidden from going to the old wharf. That evening, the Reverend urges Mike to walk alone to his friend SKUNKY'S house. The Reverend is meeting with a fellowship group when a fearful Mike appears. He claims that Simmons is lurking nearby. The Reverend is skeptical but goes out to investigate. No one is there, but he does find a distinctive tin of cigarette butts just like the one he saw Simmons carrying. At home later that night, the Reverend finds Skunky at his son's window. He persuades Skunky not to run away from home just yet. Then the Reverend calls the police, but Martin isn't in. Lisa overhears the conversation and is very worried. The next day, the Reverend tells Martin about the incident aboard the boat and about the cigarette butts. The cop is skeptical that Simmons is menacing the family, especially after they cannot find the cigarette butts. That Sunday, the Reverend presides over church services. Mike is singing in the choir when he notices the ponies arrive for the church bazaar. The Reverend is spooked when Simmons briefly appears at the back of the church. The clergyman panics after he notices that Billy is missing. The Reverend frantically searches the church grounds for his son and finally finds him sitting atop a pony. He orders the boy to go home with his mother's NURSE. Meanwhile, Simmons enters the Reverend's home, kicks at Mike's toys and then approaches the terrified Lisa. She pulls the bandages off her eyes and flees from Simmons. Mike finds his mother cowering in a closet. Afterwards, a skeptical Martin says there is no proof that Simmons was in the Reverend's home. Lisa is hysterical so the Nurse administers a sedative. Later, Mike is in the first bout at the church bazaar's peewee boxing contest. The Reverend is the referee. Simmons slinks into the tent where the match is being held and sets fire to a pail of rags. The billowing smoke creates a panic. In the confusion, Mike wanders under the stands and Simmons grabs him. Mike screams and the Reverend wrestles Simmons to the ground. But when Simmons croaks out the word murderer, the Reverend releases him. Later at the police station, Martin says there is no real evidence that Simmons set the fire. He bluntly tells the Reverend that they can't do anything until Simmons commits a crime, and then it will be too late. The Reverend goes home and tells his family to start packing; they are leaving town to escape from Simmons. However, Skunky's parents call from the hospital and say their son is asking for the Reverend. Skunky was injured during the fire. The Reverend goes to the hospital. He is unaware that Simmons is watching his every move. Then Simmons phones Lisa, impersonates a hospital employee, and says that the Skunky is asking for Mike. The Nurse drives Lisa and Mike to the hospital. The boy runs ahead of his mother and he is snatched by Simmons. Mike escapes from Simmons and flees to the nearby beach. Meanwhile, Lisa finds her husband and they realize that the phone call was a ruse. They go outside and the Reverend chases after Simmons and Mike. The boy hides among the pier pilings but Simmons spots him. Mike climbs out underneath the pier over deep water. Simmons chases him. The Reverend soon catches up to them. Simmons loses his footing and falls in the water. Simmons is drowning so the Reverend dives in and rescues him. Mike makes his way back to the beach where the Reverend insists he never hated Simmons son and he begs the man's forgiveness. Simmons cries and then departs. The Reverend and his family watch him go.","description_full":"Burglar FRANKIE breaks into a suburban home through MIKE's (7) bedroom window. The boy is asleep in his bed.

Also, Clark Baker, who had power-of-attorney during Alan's absence, had sold the firm to one of the employees, Jim McGinnis. Alan explains to Jim McGinnis that Clark Baker only had power of attorney to run the business, not to sell it without Alan's consent. McGinnis implies that Alan was duly informed ahead of time via letters sent to him while he was a POW in Korea. Feigning compassion, McGinnis offers Alan a job because their clients respect and trust the Eaton name. Alan Eaton asks for time to consider the offer. He then visits his old friend, Senator Walder, who voices his suspicions regarding the illegal manipulation of polls by the new owner of the firm, Jim McGinnis. The Senator encourages Alan Eaton to accept the job with McGinnis' firm and investigate any irregularity. In the course of his investigation, Alan, with the help of sympathetic young secretary, Lorraine Dennis, uncovers the whole illegal affair. He discovers that Jim McGinnis falsifies the statistics and poll data in order to make or break various candidates to public office. In his efforts, McGinnis, who makes big bucks out of this, is aided by a network of subversives. However, Alan and Lorraine know that uncovering facts is one thing and proving them is another thing. They must gather evidence and go to the authorities, even if this means risking their lives.—nufs68","yt_trailer_code":"","language":"en","mpa_rating":"","background_image":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/the_fearmakers_1958/background.jpg","background_image_original":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/the_fearmakers_1958/background.jpg","small_cover_image":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/the_fearmakers_1958/small-cover.jpg","medium_cover_image":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/the_fearmakers_1958/medium-cover.jpg","large_cover_image":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/the_fearmakers_1958/large-cover.jpg","state":"ok","torrents":[{"url":"https://yts.mx/torrent/download/B90C7984B2757A751CB0517AD2299C97DF3B50D7","hash":"B90C7984B2757A751CB0517AD2299C97DF3B50D7","quality":"720p","type":"bluray","is_repack":"0","video_codec":"x264","bit_depth":"8","audio_channels":"2.0","seeds":3,"peers":2,"size":"775.09 MB","size_bytes":812740772,"date_uploaded":"2023-12-09 06:35:53","date_uploaded_unix":1702100153},{"url":"https://yts.mx/torrent/download/82CA33D77AD9DEC0E4257567563735BAC2AAB64C","hash":"82CA33D77AD9DEC0E4257567563735BAC2AAB64C","quality":"1080p","type":"bluray","is_repack":"0","video_codec":"x264","bit_depth":"8","audio_channels":"2.0","seeds":9,"peers":1,"size":"1.41 GB","size_bytes":1513975972,"date_uploaded":"2023-12-09 07:36:39","date_uploaded_unix":1702103799}],"date_uploaded":"2023-12-09 06:35:53","date_uploaded_unix":1702100153},{"id":58365,"url":"https://yts.mx/movies/the-house-on-92nd-street-1945","imdb_code":"tt0037795","title":"The House on 92nd Street","title_english":"The House on 92nd Street","title_long":"The House on 92nd Street (1945)","slug":"the-house-on-92nd-street-1945","year":1945,"rating":6.6,"runtime":88,"genres":["Action","Crime","Drama","Film-Noir","Mystery","Thriller","War"],"summary":"Preface: a stentorian narrator tells us that the USA was flooded with Nazi spies in 1939-41.

His raw talent would thrust him into the spotlight and put him at the center of a cultural revolution, backing Bob Dylan on his notorious 1966 \"electric\" world tour and later, as a member of The Band, collaborating with Dylan on the ground-breaking Basement Tapes and inventing Americana with songs like \"The Weight,\" \"Up on Cripple Creek\" and \"The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down.\" After 17 years, The Band called it quits with a lavish farewell concert on November 25th, 1976, at San Francisco' Winterland Ballroom, immortalized in the seminal concert film, The Last Waltz, directed by Martin Scorsese - considered by many as the greatest rock and roll film of all time.","yt_trailer_code":"ZYTpMZjZxwI","language":"en","mpa_rating":"R","background_image":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/once_were_brothers_2019/background.jpg","background_image_original":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/once_were_brothers_2019/background.jpg","small_cover_image":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/once_were_brothers_2019/small-cover.jpg","medium_cover_image":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/once_were_brothers_2019/medium-cover.jpg","large_cover_image":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/once_were_brothers_2019/large-cover.jpg","state":"ok","torrents":[{"url":"https://yts.mx/torrent/download/C497DA5B86DD4D723355CD9ABC2D4B7729612D1C","hash":"C497DA5B86DD4D723355CD9ABC2D4B7729612D1C","quality":"720p","type":"bluray","is_repack":"0","video_codec":"x264","bit_depth":"8","audio_channels":"2.0","seeds":15,"peers":0,"size":"934.87 MB","size_bytes":980282245,"date_uploaded":"2024-01-17 23:27:34","date_uploaded_unix":1705530454},{"url":"https://yts.mx/torrent/download/D8571146743BBA02C710EE0D3AE69329F63566D0","hash":"D8571146743BBA02C710EE0D3AE69329F63566D0","quality":"1080p","type":"bluray","is_repack":"0","video_codec":"x264","bit_depth":"8","audio_channels":"5.1","seeds":16,"peers":4,"size":"1.87 GB","size_bytes":2007897211,"date_uploaded":"2024-01-18 00:47:20","date_uploaded_unix":1705535240}],"date_uploaded":"2024-01-17 23:27:34","date_uploaded_unix":1705530454},{"id":59202,"url":"https://yts.mx/movies/the-midwife-2015","imdb_code":"tt3298600","title":"The Midwife","title_english":"The Midwife","title_long":"The Midwife (2015)","slug":"the-midwife-2015","year":2015,"rating":6,"runtime":119,"genres":["Drama","History","Romance","Thriller","War"],"summary":"","description_full":"","synopsis":"","yt_trailer_code":"UossBRe7_eA","language":"fi","mpa_rating":"","background_image":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/the_midwife_2015/background.jpg","background_image_original":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/the_midwife_2015/background.jpg","small_cover_image":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/the_midwife_2015/small-cover.jpg","medium_cover_image":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/the_midwife_2015/medium-cover.jpg","large_cover_image":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/the_midwife_2015/large-cover.jpg","state":"ok","torrents":[{"url":"https://yts.mx/torrent/download/12B526745A08D43A420F622197FEB3F6F8A931E4","hash":"12B526745A08D43A420F622197FEB3F6F8A931E4","quality":"720p","type":"bluray","is_repack":"0","video_codec":"x264","bit_depth":"8","audio_channels":"2.0","seeds":10,"peers":2,"size":"1.06 GB","size_bytes":1138166333,"date_uploaded":"2024-01-12 13:46:03","date_uploaded_unix":1705063563},{"url":"https://yts.mx/torrent/download/DA96A74B31CEEC31909F96D4867B7712DA0EA2F2","hash":"DA96A74B31CEEC31909F96D4867B7712DA0EA2F2","quality":"1080p","type":"bluray","is_repack":"0","video_codec":"x264","bit_depth":"8","audio_channels":"5.1","seeds":10,"peers":1,"size":"2.19 GB","size_bytes":2351494595,"date_uploaded":"2024-01-12 15:05:19","date_uploaded_unix":1705068319}],"date_uploaded":"2024-01-12 13:46:03","date_uploaded_unix":1705063563},{"id":59172,"url":"https://yts.mx/movies/spartacus-2004","imdb_code":"tt0361240","title":"Spartacus","title_english":"Spartacus","title_long":"Spartacus (2004)","slug":"spartacus-2004","year":2004,"rating":6.6,"runtime":174,"genres":["Action","Drama","History"],"summary":"Sentenced to spend out the rest of his adult life laboring in the harsh deserts of Egypt, the Thracian slave Spartacus gets a new lease on life when he is purchased by the obese owner of a Roman gladiator school.

Eve and Raymond are shown running, with Raymond yelling for David, and ending with Eve crying, screaming for David.A year after the loss of David, Eve and Raymond become the foster parents of a recently orphaned boy named Ethan Snow (Bobby Coleman) and his teenage sister Abby (Jordan Hinson).Abby and Ethan would rather live with Ben Koch (Jason London), a cop who has known them all their lives via his friendship with their parents, and cares deeply about them. He'd love to take them in, if he felt that he was qualified or capable of raising them, but he lives in a one bedroom apartment.Abby and Ethan are soon swept away by the wonderfulness of their new foster parents, and the incredible house that is their new home.Ethan gets his own room with a bathroom close to the master bedroom, but Abby gets the bedroom that's the farthest from Ethan's room, in a part of the house called the tower.

When a case worker (Tasha Smith) visits to check up on everything, David's bed is no longer in the basement.What Abby discovers is that Eve is highly unstable. While doting on Ethan, Eve competes with Abby for his love, and develops a spiteful and increasingly violent relationship with Abby as Abby grows more and more rebellious because of her suspicions of Eve and Raymond.The violence starts with Eve slapping Abby for using a four letter word against her. Eve even causes Abby to cut her arm deeply by deliberately leaving already-broken glasses in a sink full of dishes that she tells Abby to wash.The dishes were covered by a thick layer of soap bubbles, so Abby didn't see the broken glasses. Eve, who used to be a nurse, stitches the wound, deliberately making the process as painful as possible. And she injects Abby with something.

Abby grabs some pictures of them as evidence.It seems that Munchausen syndrome by proxy has led to Eve killing a number of foster sons. Abby realizes that she and Ethan have to save themselves from Eve before she can kill them.Abby gets Ethan, who is still sick, outside of the house and inside of a car, and then Abby sees Raymond returning home. Abby rushes Ethan back to his bedroom. Abby promises Ethan that she'll go get Ben, and bring him back with her.In a hallway, a furious Eve finds Abby, and shakes her, causing the pictures to drop to the floor. Eve viciously smacks Abby, drags her into the nearby attic, kicks her to the floor, and locks her in.After a while, Eve brings some food to Abby, and leaves. Abby thinks it might be spiked with whatever's making Ethan sick.

It's Ben, who immediately hangs up.Ben, who is just down the hill from the house, has started suspecting Eve and Raymond of child endangerment, so he called to make sure they're home. Ben alerts his colleagues at the LAPD. Over the house's intercom, Eve tells Abby that she's not going anywhere.Abby goes out to the garage, and starts up the SUV, but she gets out of it so she can open the garage door.

A renowned, brilliant, and humane surgeon, he also happens to be a necrophiliac who enjoys sexual games with his beautiful and very willing wife, Margaretha. The games include slowing his wife's pulse with this anaesthetic so that she seems corpse-like. Sadly, one night, he injects her with too much and she dies in his arms. Devastated and traumatized, he resigns from his position and leaves England, the reason for his wife's death, of course, never publicly revealed. He returns twelve years later, remarried to Cynthia. His housekeeper, Martha, who was loyal to him and Margaretha, and even a devilishly delighted romantic co-conspirator in preparing the funeral-parlor-like room for their sex games, makes it clear that she views his remarriage as a betrayal: she treats Cynthia coldly and Bernard with scornful glances and without the familial devotion she showed before Margaretha's death.

The subject matter of the film was revolutionary for its day and indeed for any period.

Her roommate Peggy (Malou Pantera) encourages her to open it and find out who sent it. It is revealed to be a pair of expensive binoculars. Gail takes it over to the window to have a look. Suddenly she screams, holding her hands over her bloody eyes and collapses on the floor. Peggy screams and runs out the door for help. The binoculars are shown to have two sharp-pointed awls which were spring-loaded and released into her eyes when she turned the focus knob.At Scotland Yard, Peggy answers questions from Supt. Graham (Geoffrey Keen) and is escorted out the door by Insp. Lodge (John Warwick). Before the door can be closed, in comes Edmund Bancroft (Michael Gough) who is scarcely welcome. Asking to see the binoculars, Bancroft says that the murderer must have seen them in the black museum of the police. He suggests maybe a disgruntled policeman might be the culprit. Graham asks if that will be the subject of his next article in the newspaper. Bancroft reminds them that they do not control the writing of his column, books or newspaper articles which are always accurate. More discussion on who the murderer might be and what weapon might next be used is interrupted by a phone call from Commissioner Wayne (Austin Trevor), who summons the police to a meeting.At the meeting Wayne finds that the police have absolutely no leads on whom the suspect might be. It is confirmed that the weapon used was like one of the ones seen in the police black museum. Wayne tells them they must find the killer.Dr. Ballan (Gerald Anderson as Gerald Andersen) tells Bancroft that he shouldnt smoke but that his real addiction is working on crime cases. After each of the recent murders Bancroft has seen the doctor for treatment: high blood pressure, racing heartbeat, etc. Bancroft refuses to take tranquilizers or slow down until the killer is caught. He insists that the police might never be able to find the perpetrator without his help. He promises the doctor that he will become obedient once the crimes are solved.Aggie (Beatrice Varley) is stocking her antique shop when Bancroft enters. She tells him she has an item he might be interested in: a music box/cigarette case. He says he is not interested but only wants clues. Finding a kris dagger with a wavy blade, he haggles with her and buys it. She tells him that she reads all his books and articles. He tells her that he believes because of her age that she is safe from the killer.Returning home to his office, Bancroft greets his assistant, Rick (Graham Curnow), who tells him there were a few crank calls after the last article came out. Bancroft insists that all information they publish be accurate. Rick asks if he should pick up the mail from readers or the cigars that came in from the tobacconist, but is told that they have more important work to do now. They go downstairs where Rick is told to unlock a door. Inside they step into Bancrofts own black museum, filled with figures of murderers and victims along with various instruments of torture and murder. Bancroft rattles on about how his museum is far superior to that of Scotland Yard and that his weapons will continue to be useful in the future. He also notes that his electronic machine will continue to make the museum alive.Meanwhile Dr. Ballon dictates notes to his nurse, in which he says he believes Bancroft is the victim of some aberration which if untreated will be fatal. He recommends psychiatric treatment.Bancroft is drinking at the apartment of Joan Berkley (June Cunningham), a blonde with whom he has been keeping company. She complains that he never takes her anywhere and that she is tired of it. He argues with her, saying that he deserves a medal for putting up with her. She insists he give her some money and he refuses. Taking up his cane, she tells him he is half a man without it, and would be no man without his money (he has been paying for her apartment, food and her company). He gets violent and smashes dishes and glasses on the table. She breaks up with him, telling him she will find a real man and for him to get out for good. He leaves in a huff.At the local tavern, Joan dances to juke box music. Many older men watch in amusement. One man asks to buy her a drink. She tells him she already has one from another man, which she sits down at a table with. She soon insults him and he leaves. Going to the bar, she tells the barman Ted (Richard Caldicot) how she intends to have fun from now on, and that no man will hold her down. He gives her a drink on the house, telling her to return soon.Walking alone down the street in the dark, she hears footsteps behind her. She turns and finds two constables (William Abney and Howard Pays) who walk her home and converse with her. Once home, she goes upstairs into her apartment and prepares for bed as the radio plays. Climbing into bed, she is horrified to observe a strange man with a horrible face looking down. She screams as he releases a guillotine which comes down, beheading her. Gathering up all his tools into a bag, he prepares to leave.Outside in the hall, neighbors complain about the scream from her apartment. One man (Sidney Bromley) knocks on the door, which suddenly opens and the culprit runs out, carrying his bag and pushing everyone aside.Supt. Graham questions two ladies in the hall (Hilda Barry and Nora Gordon) who claim it was an older man with a wrinkled face. Another man claims it was the devil or someone who looked like him. One woman tells that he wore a jacket like the young students wear. Graham thanks them all and leaves, telling the constable to remain.A little girl (Ingrid Cardon) tells the constable that she saw the man who entered the apartment earlier with a cane and unlocked the door with a key. Her mother suggests that she made this up or saw it on television. They are all told to go to bed by the constable, and all leave.At the crime scene, Graham and Lodge discuss what they see. Lodge says the head has not been found. The medical examiner (Frank Henderson) suggests maybe it was a guillotine and that she didnt have a chance.

One man (Edgar Driver) comments on the story as does another woman.Bancroft is attending a party thrown by his publisher for his new book which has just come out when Graham enters. They immediately begin discussing the case, with Graham saying that Bancroft knows too much about the case. Before leaving, Graham mentions that the culprit has been caught and has confessed to all four crimes. Bancroft seems uninterested in the details but thanks him for the offer.The suspect, Tom Rivers (Howard Greene) demands to see Comm. Wayne and Supt. Graham. He wants to confess to additional murders committed before. He claims to have strangled a waitress in Dover with his bare hands. Bragging about how good he is with his hands, he claims he can build anything. He tells them his next weapon will be a death ray which he is working on, which he will shoot from his eyes. As his stories become wilder, Wayne and Graham leave. Outside the cell, the Sergeant (Geoffrey Denton) comes with a report saying that Rivers was discharged from the military and has been in and out of three mental institutions but is harmless. Graham says these false confessors always memorize the details to seem impressive. He suggests to Wayne that Rivers be detained longer so the press will comment, hoping the killer will be flushed out. Wayne agrees.Reading the paper, Bancroft gloats at the details offered by the press. Rick is surprised when Bancroft tells him they wont get a photo of Rivers for his article. He tells Rick that they will dig out other false confessions from his archives. Bancroft tells Rick he will be gone for a couple of hours and leaves. Rick waits until he is out of sight, looks at his watch, and rushes out.In the park, Rick meets his girlfriend, Angela Banks (Shirley Anne Field as Shirley Ann Field) and promises to tell his employer (Bancroft) about them soon. He confesses that Bancroft has a hold over him to the point where he is unable to refuse anything. She urges him to stand up for himself and tell about their relationship. He promises but swears he has to get back.Entering the antique shop, Bancroft finds Aggie waiting for him. She says he always comes after each murder. She has something for him: large ice tongs. He says he believes he would be interested in them. She tells him the price is £1200, to which he says she is out of her mind. She says he will pay it because she has helped him all this time but that he is the one making all the money. She confesses that she knows that it was he who killed the woman with the binoculars she sold him (because she saw her mark on them in the newspaper photo, which she shows him). He agrees to pay her, but says he doesnt carry that much cash with him. She tells him to bring it tomorrow and turns away. Grabbing the tongs, he seizes her neck with them. She falls bleeding to the floor. He wipes fingerprints off the tongs, the magnifying glass and the doorknob on his way out.The next morning Rick drives Bancroft to Scotland Yard where a newspaper seller announces that a shopkeeper has been murdered. Bancroft tells Rick that the police will be unable to find the murderer without any fingerprints. Rick is told to go back to work and that Bancroft will return by taxi.Bancroft comes in to gloat that the police are not able to do anything and asks to interview Rivers. He tells Graham that he will show in his article that the police are not infallible and will cast a sympathetic view in writing. Graham tells him he is too late; that Rivers was confined to a mental institution. Bancroft leaves, telling Graham  better luck next time in catching the murderer. Working in his museum, Bancroft is operating the machine when the door buzzer sounds. He tells Rick to answer it. Dr. Ballon comes in and confronts Bancroft, saying that Bancroft has perpetrated the murders and needs to be institutionalized. He tells him to accompany him to the police, where he will explain the aberration and have Bancroft put away. Pretending to surrender, Bancroft tells Ballon he will do so now. When Bancroft throws a switch on the machine, Ballon is struck with a death ray, killing him. He tells Rick to help him with the body. A chain is attached, and the body is lowered into a vat of acid for a few moments. When it is removed, only a skeleton remains. Bancroft notices that Rick seems hesitant to do his commands. He tells Rick to hang the skeleton up on the wall and take the night off.Bancroft is appearing at the local bookstore to autograph his book  TERROR IN THE NIGHT . Several people are seen telling him what to write. The bookshop manager (Gerald Case) tells him they sold over 200 copies and it was most successful. Inquiring about the next book, he is told it will be his best so far.Coming home early, Bancroft is horrified to see Rick kissing Angela in the black museum. She tells him they plan to be married soon and that Rick tells her everything about his work. Bancroft tells her next time he will lead her on a tour of his museum. He tells Rick to take her home because they have work to do. She insists that Rick was to take her to the fun fair. He suggests she wait upstairs while he dictates notes to Rick and then they can go. She says she will read his book and goes upstairs.Bancroft turns his anger on Rick and chews him out for bringing Angela into their secret museum. Rick admits he was wrong and wants to know how to appease him. Bancroft prepares a syringe, telling Rick he has waited too long between treatments. Giving Rick the injection, he ascertains that no one else knew about tonight. He tells Rick that one day all this will belong to him; that he will go further than Bancroft did-into the very black soul of man. He reveals that the injections prove that Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde was not just a story, but a reality he is proving. He tells Rick to take Angela to the fair and do exactly as he is told.Rick and Angela walk around at the fair. When Rick bumps into a passing man, he becomes angry and Angela is surprised. He confesses that he lost his temper. He tells her that from what he has learned he will greatly benefit from Bancroft.They come to where a strength-test barker (Stuart Saunders) is calling for young men to hit the bell at the top of the pole by striking the bottom with a large hammer. The barker taunts Rick about his strength, but Rick insists he will do it. Taking the hammer, he pounds it and rings the bell to the astonishment of the barker and amusement of everyone watching.Angela encourages Rick to stand up to Bancroft and tell him off. She believes he should find another job. Maybe it is working for Bancroft that causes Ricks anger. He doesnt want to talk about it. She says it is a closed subject for tonight. They go into the Tunnel of Love.In the dark, several couples are heard talking. One couple has the woman wanting to smooch, and the other has the man wanting to. When Rick and Angela come out at the end, Ricks face has transformed into that of the killer. Angela screams and Rick stabs her with the dagger. He runs off through the fairway and goes into the Hall of Mirrors. Several people are looking at their distorted images in the mirrors. Rick comes in and looks at his face in one of them. A girl (Carole Ann Ford) notices him looking and asks to borrow his face to scare her boss. When he turns around with the dagger she screams and runs away. He leaves there and goes to the Ferris wheel where he climbs up high. Police and bystanders watch from below as the wheel is stopped.Bancroft brings the draft of his article to Graham and Lodge to inspect. Graham receives a call that the killer is trapped at the fair. They leave and Bancroft insists on coming along, saying he absolutely must have this story.Arriving at the fair, Graham and Lodge are directed to where Rick is atop the ride. They shout for him to come down and they will not shoot. Bancroft comes alongside and looks up at him. Lodge calls for him to come down once more. Rick calls down to Bancroft, telling him that he did everything Bancroft told him to do. Bancroft angrily calls for the police to shoot him down, saying hes a dangerous criminal. At this point Rick jumps and is shot by a policeman. He falls on Bancroft, stabbing him with the dagger. Graham and Lodge crowd around and Graham announces that the monster murderer has been caught.","description_full":"HORRORS OF THE BLACK MUSEUM In London a delivery truck pulls up in front of an apartment building and the postman (Frank Forsyth) delivers a package to Gail Dunlap (Dorinda Stevens), who signs for it and takes it inside. Her roommate Peggy (Malou Pantera) encourages her to open it and find out who sent it. It is revealed to be a pair of expensive binoculars. Gail takes it over to the window to have a look. Suddenly she screams, holding her hands over her bloody eyes and collapses on the floor. Peggy screams and runs out the door for help. The binoculars are shown to have two sharp-pointed awls which were spring-loaded and released into her eyes when she turned the focus knob.At Scotland Yard, Peggy answers questions from Supt. Graham (Geoffrey Keen) and is escorted out the door by Insp. Lodge (John Warwick). Before the door can be closed, in comes Edmund Bancroft (Michael Gough) who is scarcely welcome. Asking to see the binoculars, Bancroft says that the murderer must have seen them in the black museum of the police. He suggests maybe a disgruntled policeman might be the culprit. Graham asks if that will be the subject of his next article in the newspaper. Bancroft reminds them that they do not control the writing of his column, books or newspaper articles which are always accurate. More discussion on who the murderer might be and what weapon might next be used is interrupted by a phone call from Commissioner Wayne (Austin Trevor), who summons the police to a meeting.At the meeting Wayne finds that the police have absolutely no leads on whom the suspect might be. It is confirmed that the weapon used was like one of the ones seen in the police black museum. Wayne tells them they must find the killer.Dr. Ballan (Gerald Anderson as Gerald Andersen) tells Bancroft that he shouldnt smoke but that his real addiction is working on crime cases. After each of the recent murders Bancroft has seen the doctor for treatment: high blood pressure, racing heartbeat, etc. Bancroft refuses to take tranquilizers or slow down until the killer is caught. He insists that the police might never be able to find the perpetrator without his help. He promises the doctor that he will become obedient once the crimes are solved.Aggie (Beatrice Varley) is stocking her antique shop when Bancroft enters. She tells him she has an item he might be interested in: a music box/cigarette case. He says he is not interested but only wants clues. Finding a kris dagger with a wavy blade, he haggles with her and buys it. She tells him that she reads all his books and articles. He tells her that he believes because of her age that she is safe from the killer.Returning home to his office, Bancroft greets his assistant, Rick (Graham Curnow), who tells him there were a few crank calls after the last article came out. Bancroft insists that all information they publish be accurate. Rick asks if he should pick up the mail from readers or the cigars that came in from the tobacconist, but is told that they have more important work to do now. They go downstairs where Rick is told to unlock a door. Inside they step into Bancrofts own black museum, filled with figures of murderers and victims along with various instruments of torture and murder. Bancroft rattles on about how his museum is far superior to that of Scotland Yard and that his weapons will continue to be useful in the future. He also notes that his electronic machine will continue to make the museum alive.Meanwhile Dr. Ballon dictates notes to his nurse, in which he says he believes Bancroft is the victim of some aberration which if untreated will be fatal. He recommends psychiatric treatment.Bancroft is drinking at the apartment of Joan Berkley (June Cunningham), a blonde with whom he has been keeping company. She complains that he never takes her anywhere and that she is tired of it. He argues with her, saying that he deserves a medal for putting up with her. She insists he give her some money and he refuses. Taking up his cane, she tells him he is half a man without it, and would be no man without his money (he has been paying for her apartment, food and her company). He gets violent and smashes dishes and glasses on the table. She breaks up with him, telling him she will find a real man and for him to get out for good. He leaves in a huff.At the local tavern, Joan dances to juke box music. Many older men watch in amusement. One man asks to buy her a drink. She tells him she already has one from another man, which she sits down at a table with. She soon insults him and he leaves. Going to the bar, she tells the barman Ted (Richard Caldicot) how she intends to have fun from now on, and that no man will hold her down. He gives her a drink on the house, telling her to return soon.Walking alone down the street in the dark, she hears footsteps behind her. She turns and finds two constables (William Abney and Howard Pays) who walk her home and converse with her. Once home, she goes upstairs into her apartment and prepares for bed as the radio plays. Climbing into bed, she is horrified to observe a strange man with a horrible face looking down. She screams as he releases a guillotine which comes down, beheading her. Gathering up all his tools into a bag, he prepares to leave.Outside in the hall, neighbors complain about the scream from her apartment. One man (Sidney Bromley) knocks on the door, which suddenly opens and the culprit runs out, carrying his bag and pushing everyone aside.Supt. Graham questions two ladies in the hall (Hilda Barry and Nora Gordon) who claim it was an older man with a wrinkled face. Another man claims it was the devil or someone who looked like him.

He tells Rick to take Angela to the fair and do exactly as he is told.Rick and Angela walk around at the fair. When Rick bumps into a passing man, he becomes angry and Angela is surprised. He confesses that he lost his temper. He tells her that from what he has learned he will greatly benefit from Bancroft.They come to where a strength-test barker (Stuart Saunders) is calling for young men to hit the bell at the top of the pole by striking the bottom with a large hammer. The barker taunts Rick about his strength, but Rick insists he will do it. Taking the hammer, he pounds it and rings the bell to the astonishment of the barker and amusement of everyone watching.Angela encourages Rick to stand up to Bancroft and tell him off. She believes he should find another job. Maybe it is working for Bancroft that causes Ricks anger. He doesnt want to talk about it. She says it is a closed subject for tonight. They go into the Tunnel of Love.In the dark, several couples are heard talking. One couple has the woman wanting to smooch, and the other has the man wanting to. When Rick and Angela come out at the end, Ricks face has transformed into that of the killer. Angela screams and Rick stabs her with the dagger. He runs off through the fairway and goes into the Hall of Mirrors. Several people are looking at their distorted images in the mirrors. Rick comes in and looks at his face in one of them. A girl (Carole Ann Ford) notices him looking and asks to borrow his face to scare her boss. When he turns around with the dagger she screams and runs away. He leaves there and goes to the Ferris wheel where he climbs up high. Police and bystanders watch from below as the wheel is stopped.Bancroft brings the draft of his article to Graham and Lodge to inspect. Graham receives a call that the killer is trapped at the fair. They leave and Bancroft insists on coming along, saying he absolutely must have this story.Arriving at the fair, Graham and Lodge are directed to where Rick is atop the ride. They shout for him to come down and they will not shoot. Bancroft comes alongside and looks up at him. Lodge calls for him to come down once more. Rick calls down to Bancroft, telling him that he did everything Bancroft told him to do. Bancroft angrily calls for the police to shoot him down, saying hes a dangerous criminal. At this point Rick jumps and is shot by a policeman. He falls on Bancroft, stabbing him with the dagger. Graham and Lodge crowd around and Graham announces that the monster murderer has been caught.","yt_trailer_code":"Pmj8H4IcGlg","language":"en","mpa_rating":"","background_image":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/horrors_of_the_black_museum_1959/background.jpg","background_image_original":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/horrors_of_the_black_museum_1959/background.jpg","small_cover_image":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/horrors_of_the_black_museum_1959/small-cover.jpg","medium_cover_image":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/horrors_of_the_black_museum_1959/medium-cover.jpg","large_cover_image":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/horrors_of_the_black_museum_1959/large-cover.jpg","state":"ok","torrents":[{"url":"https://yts.mx/torrent/download/237968B111715FC9FF642EDAE891B989E05F0B9C","hash":"237968B111715FC9FF642EDAE891B989E05F0B9C","quality":"720p","type":"bluray","is_repack":"0","video_codec":"x264","bit_depth":"8","audio_channels":"2.0","seeds":26,"peers":1,"size":"751.15 MB","size_bytes":787637862,"date_uploaded":"2024-01-31 09:52:14","date_uploaded_unix":1706691134},{"url":"https://yts.mx/torrent/download/9D29F053C759CAF8AFFC239AF9F5EFA8A121A303","hash":"9D29F053C759CAF8AFFC239AF9F5EFA8A121A303","quality":"1080p","type":"bluray","is_repack":"0","video_codec":"x264","bit_depth":"8","audio_channels":"2.0","seeds":59,"peers":9,"size":"1.36 GB","size_bytes":1460288881,"date_uploaded":"2024-01-31 10:44:14","date_uploaded_unix":1706694254}],"date_uploaded":"2024-01-31 09:52:14","date_uploaded_unix":1706691134},{"id":59510,"url":"https://yts.mx/movies/devil-girl-from-mars-1954","imdb_code":"tt0046907","title":"Devil Girl from Mars","title_english":"Devil Girl from Mars","title_long":"Devil Girl from Mars (1954)","slug":"devil-girl-from-mars-1954","year":1954,"rating":4.9,"runtime":77,"genres":["Horror","Sci-Fi"],"summary":"In a Scottish inn, the owners, employees and guests are reunited in the bar.

His raw talent would thrust him into the spotlight and put him at the center of a cultural revolution, backing Bob Dylan on his notorious 1966 \"electric\" world tour and later, as a member of The Band, collaborating with Dylan on the ground-breaking Basement Tapes and inventing Americana with songs like \"The Weight,\" \"Up on Cripple Creek\" and \"The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down.\" After 17 years, The Band called it quits with a lavish farewell concert on November 25th, 1976, at San Francisco' Winterland Ballroom, immortalized in the seminal concert film, The Last Waltz, directed by Martin Scorsese - considered by many as the greatest rock and roll film of all time.","yt_trailer_code":"ZYTpMZjZxwI","language":"en","mpa_rating":"R","background_image":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/once_were_brothers_2019/background.jpg","background_image_original":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/once_were_brothers_2019/background.jpg","small_cover_image":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/once_were_brothers_2019/small-cover.jpg","medium_cover_image":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/once_were_brothers_2019/medium-cover.jpg","large_cover_image":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/once_were_brothers_2019/large-cover.jpg","state":"ok","torrents":[{"url":"https://yts.mx/torrent/download/C497DA5B86DD4D723355CD9ABC2D4B7729612D1C","hash":"C497DA5B86DD4D723355CD9ABC2D4B7729612D1C","quality":"720p","type":"bluray","is_repack":"0","video_codec":"x264","bit_depth":"8","audio_channels":"2.0","seeds":15,"peers":0,"size":"934.87 MB","size_bytes":980282245,"date_uploaded":"2024-01-17 23:27:34","date_uploaded_unix":1705530454},{"url":"https://yts.mx/torrent/download/D8571146743BBA02C710EE0D3AE69329F63566D0","hash":"D8571146743BBA02C710EE0D3AE69329F63566D0","quality":"1080p","type":"bluray","is_repack":"0","video_codec":"x264","bit_depth":"8","audio_channels":"5.1","seeds":16,"peers":4,"size":"1.87 GB","size_bytes":2007897211,"date_uploaded":"2024-01-18 00:47:20","date_uploaded_unix":1705535240}],"date_uploaded":"2024-01-17 23:27:34","date_uploaded_unix":1705530454},{"id":59255,"url":"https://yts.mx/movies/june-2023","imdb_code":"tt18350228","title":"June","title_english":"June","title_long":"June (2023)","slug":"june-2023","year":2023,"rating":7.8,"runtime":98,"genres":["Documentary","Music"],"summary":"","description_full":"","synopsis":"","yt_trailer_code":"gqa1JAIn6uU","language":"en","mpa_rating":"","background_image":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/june_2023/background.jpg","background_image_original":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/june_2023/background.jpg","small_cover_image":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/june_2023/small-cover.jpg","medium_cover_image":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/june_2023/medium-cover.jpg","large_cover_image":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/june_2023/large-cover.jpg","state":"ok","torrents":[{"url":"https://yts.mx/torrent/download/A4BA6F546C05A5AA4226D1C961237F6C62018F2B","hash":"A4BA6F546C05A5AA4226D1C961237F6C62018F2B","quality":"720p","type":"web","is_repack":"0","video_codec":"x264","bit_depth":"8","audio_channels":"2.0","seeds":17,"peers":0,"size":"904.82 MB","size_bytes":948772536,"date_uploaded":"2024-01-16 13:12:16","date_uploaded_unix":1705407136},{"url":"https://yts.mx/torrent/download/8A57DC8F46C397554956FB3F68B539E94EC315DD","hash":"8A57DC8F46C397554956FB3F68B539E94EC315DD","quality":"1080p","type":"web","is_repack":"0","video_codec":"x264","bit_depth":"8","audio_channels":"5.1","seeds":28,"peers":2,"size":"1.81 GB","size_bytes":1943472701,"date_uploaded":"2024-01-16 14:17:32","date_uploaded_unix":1705411052}],"date_uploaded":"2024-01-16 13:12:16","date_uploaded_unix":1705407136},{"id":59176,"url":"https://yts.mx/movies/welcome-to-the-darkness-2023","imdb_code":"tt28486112","title":"Welcome to the Darkness","title_english":"Welcome to the Darkness","title_long":"Welcome to the Darkness (2023)","slug":"welcome-to-the-darkness-2023","year":2023,"rating":7.7,"runtime":90,"genres":["Action","Documentary","Music"],"summary":"\"In 2003, British glam rockers The Darkness took the world by storm with their smash hit single \"I Believe In A Thing Called Love\".

Having studied magic and sorcery, Magnifico gained the ability to grant the wishes of his subjects. When each resident turns 18, a ceremony is held where they give up their wish to Magnifico, who keeps them sealed in his observatory. Once a month, Magnifico selects one of the residents' wishes to be granted before the city.\nIn the present day, 17-year-old Asha prepares to interview for the role of Magnifico's apprentice, along with her pet goat Valentino. It is her grandfather Sabino's 100th birthday, and Asha hopes Magnifico will grant his wish in commemoration. Her best friend Dahlia, who runs the castle bakery alongside their six friends Simon, Gabo, Bazeema, Safi, Dario, and Hal, advises Asha to be honest about her weaknesses. The interview initially goes well, with Magnifico and Asha expressing a shared desire to protect the wishes of Rosas. However, when Asha requests for Sabino's wish to be granted, Magnifico refuses. A heated argument ensues, and it is revealed that Magnifico erases the memories of the citizens' wishes when they are made, and never returns the ungranted wishes to their owners. In doing so, the populace is rendered docile and free of aspirations, and thus dependent on Magnifico.\nAt the wish-granting ceremony that evening, Magnifico makes a point of not granting Sabino's wish, and dismisses Asha as his apprentice. Asha tries to tell her family the truth about Magnifico, but they do not believe her.

He crushes her mother Sakina's wish as punishment, causing Sakina to be overcome with grief. Star tries to defend her, but is spotted by Magnifico, who vows to capture him. Asha and her family flee with Star; Sabino and Sakina are sent to a neighboring island for safety while Asha returns to the city in pursuit of the other wishes.

Willy then goes to look at a store he plans to buy. That evening, Willy gets everything out and plans to sleep on a park bench, until a dog called \"Tiddles\" comes and sniffs his leg and a man tells him to come and spend the night in his sanctuary.Once inside Scrubit and Bleachers sanctuary, Willy heads for the fireplace to warm up. Mrs Scrubit then shows Willy a contract to sign, and a girl who works there called Noodle tells him to read the contract carefully, but Willy just instantly signs. Mrs Scrubit then tells Noodle off and throws her in a coup. The next day, Willy heads back to the Gourmet store and tells the public about his new flying chocolates and a trio of Chocolatiers see this and call the police, before going out and tasting some. After negatively criticizing Willy, the three start floating around and the police arrive. Willy asks the Chief of police for some money for his rent and he hands him a silver coin. Unfortunately however, Willy didn't read the contract properly and that coin wouldn't be enough and Mrs Scrubit tells Willy he will have to work off the rest of the debt. Willy then goes down the laundry Shute and meets a bunch of other people who suffered similar fates to him.That night, Noodle came into Willys room and tells him she has never tasted chocolate, so Willy makes her a chocolate treat, using his chocolate making machine and tells her the story of his childhood. His mother used to make great chocolate and they had planned to take over the store in the Gourmet store that Willy wanted, but she had died soon after and he had never found out her secret. Noodle takes a bite of the chocolate and enjoys it, but is saddened by the fact that she won't be able to have more, so Willy offers her a lifetime supply of chocolate and Noodle tells Willy one way they can escape. Meanwhile, underneath the cathedral, the Chief of police is meeting with the Chocolatiers and through a song, encourage him to eliminate the competition and get rid of Wonka, by offering him 1,000 boxes of chocolate and he agrees.The next morning, Willy and Noodle attempt to get Scrubit and Bleacher to fall in love and Willy goes back down the Shute, and reveals an invention, which will do everyone's work for them and he and Noodle escape. Now on the streets, Willy tells Noodle about a \"little orange man with green hair\" who keeps stealing his chocolates, but Noodle doesn't believe him. Then Willy says that he needs to make more chocolate and he needs the milk from a giraffe to make it. At the zoo, they knock out the security guard by giving him a chocolate that goes through all sorts of alcoholic beverages and the two sneak in. Once inside the zoo, it is revealed that Willy cannot read as he opens the door to the tiger instead of the giraffe. Noodle opens the door to the giraffe and whilst Willy milks the giraffe Noodle tells him that her name isn't really Noodle, only assumed to be, when Scrubit found her in a basket, with an \"N\" on her necklace. On the way out of the zoo, Willy grabs hold of some balloons and floats to the roof of the Gourmet store, where he and Noodle sing and dance, but the police see them. The Chief of police has a conversation with Willy and the two sneak back into the workshop.One of them tells the story of how the Trio have been in cahoots for a long time and he used to work for one (Slugworth), but got fired for snooping around and Willy tells them he is a chocolate maker and his dream of owning the store. That night, Willy passes Noodle her chocolates and the gang have a conversation and agree to help Willy with his dream.The following day, Willy tries out all sorts of new delicious confectionery on the members of the public and the police follow him on bicycles. Eventually, the Chief of police finds a chocolate wrapper and figures out that he has been escaping through the drains in the road. That night, the Chief of police asks the Chocolatiers for more chocolate and they agree. Meanwhile in Willys room, the little orange man comes back, but gets caught in a trap Willy had set and wakes him up. The man tells Willy that he is an Oompa Loompa and he is disappointed at Willy for stealing cocoa beans from Loompaland Land and that he won't go away until he has all the chocolate he requires, before hitting Willy with a frying pan and escaping with the chocolate.The next day, the friends showed Willy the keys to the store and open it up. At first it was a bit of a dump, but they soon got it all up to scratch. The grand opening went really well, until it is revealed that someone had sabotaged the treats and the customers all riot, burning down the store. The others leave Willy alone in the rubble and the three Chocolatiers arrive with a brief case full of money, which they will give to his friends, if he leaves town for good and Willy agrees. Later that evening, Willy arrives at the docks, shakes Slugworth's hand and sets sail. Also on board was the Oompa Loompa and he tells Willy he won't leave him alone until he gets the chocolate and Willy notices an \"A\" mark on his hand and realizes that Noodle is in great danger. Willy and the Oompa Loompa go to see the captain, but see dynamite strapped to the wheel instead. The duo jump off and the Chocolatiers just stand and laugh as the boat explodes. Slugworth then goes to give Scrubit the money.The next morning, Mrs Scrubit and Mr Bleacher let everyone go with their money, but tells Noodle that her money was to keep her there and Mrs Scrubit grabs her and throws her in the coup again. Suddenly, Willy appears and tells Noodle that they are going to go and steal the ledger and break Noodle free from the coup. At the cathedral, Noodle is disguised as a nun and asks the father for some chocolate, but he refuses. Willy and a couple others go to the zoo, steal the giraffe and let it loose in the cathedral. The father phones the \"zoo\", which is Willy and his friends on the other side of the phone and tells them to get rid of it. They do so, just before the Baron's funeral. After hearing what had happened, Slugworth calls the father and rushes to the cathedral. Meanwhile, Willy and Noodle had entered underneath the cathedral and started searching for the book. Finally, Noodle opened a trap door in the wall and got out the book. Unfortunately, Slugworth and his companions got them and throw them in a giant chocolate mixer. Slugworth then tells them that the \"N\" is actually a \"Z\", which belonged to his brother \"Zebbedy\" and told Noodle that he told her mother she would be in good hands, but instead, threw her down the laundry Shute and told her mother that she had died, before locking the door, taking Willys chocolates for the Oompa Loompa, eating them and leaving Willy and Noodle to drown in a river of chocolate. Noodle however, had a plan to let the chocolate lift them and they could bang on the glass. Unfortunately, no one would help them and the two went under.Fortunately, the Oompa Loompa came to the rescue and the duo got out with the book. The now oversized Chief of police got out of the car and is told that he as well as the Chocolatiers are under arrest. The Chocolatiers then start floating again and Willy reveals that the chocolate they had eaten were actually the flying chocolates from earlier on. Slugworth claims they'll be back before floating away.Willy then finally finds out his mother's secret that it's the people you share the chocolate with that matters, not the chocolate itself. Willy shares a piece with everyone, before telling Noodle that her mother lives at the local library and the two get reacquainted and Willy shows the Oompa Loompa an old castle, which he plans to make into a factory and the Oompa Loompa becomes Chief chocolate taster.As the credits roll, the Oompa Loompa reveals what happened to everyone, including Scrubit and Bleacher, who were under arrest, but tried to get out of it by eating the poisoned chocolates and the two have one last kiss.","description_full":"A ship sails towards land and a young Willy Wonka stands on top of a mast, singing a song and when the ship ports in dock, Willy continues singing, but gives away all but 1 of his silver coins, the last of which he drops down a drain. Willy then goes to look at a store he plans to buy. That evening, Willy gets everything out and plans to sleep on a park bench, until a dog called \"Tiddles\" comes and sniffs his leg and a man tells him to come and spend the night in his sanctuary.Once inside Scrubit and Bleachers sanctuary, Willy heads for the fireplace to warm up. Mrs Scrubit then shows Willy a contract to sign, and a girl who works there called Noodle tells him to read the contract carefully, but Willy just instantly signs. Mrs Scrubit then tells Noodle off and throws her in a coup. The next day, Willy heads back to the Gourmet store and tells the public about his new flying chocolates and a trio of Chocolatiers see this and call the police, before going out and tasting some. After negatively criticizing Willy, the three start floating around and the police arrive. Willy asks the Chief of police for some money for his rent and he hands him a silver coin. Unfortunately however, Willy didn't read the contract properly and that coin wouldn't be enough and Mrs Scrubit tells Willy he will have to work off the rest of the debt. Willy then goes down the laundry Shute and meets a bunch of other people who suffered similar fates to him.That night, Noodle came into Willys room and tells him she has never tasted chocolate, so Willy makes her a chocolate treat, using his chocolate making machine and tells her the story of his childhood. His mother used to make great chocolate and they had planned to take over the store in the Gourmet store that Willy wanted, but she had died soon after and he had never found out her secret. Noodle takes a bite of the chocolate and enjoys it, but is saddened by the fact that she won't be able to have more, so Willy offers her a lifetime supply of chocolate and Noodle tells Willy one way they can escape. Meanwhile, underneath the cathedral, the Chief of police is meeting with the Chocolatiers and through a song, encourage him to eliminate the competition and get rid of Wonka, by offering him 1,000 boxes of chocolate and he agrees.The next morning, Willy and Noodle attempt to get Scrubit and Bleacher to fall in love and Willy goes back down the Shute, and reveals an invention, which will do everyone's work for them and he and Noodle escape. Now on the streets, Willy tells Noodle about a \"little orange man with green hair\" who keeps stealing his chocolates, but Noodle doesn't believe him. Then Willy says that he needs to make more chocolate and he needs the milk from a giraffe to make it. At the zoo, they knock out the security guard by giving him a chocolate that goes through all sorts of alcoholic beverages and the two sneak in. Once inside the zoo, it is revealed that Willy cannot read as he opens the door to the tiger instead of the giraffe. Noodle opens the door to the giraffe and whilst Willy milks the giraffe Noodle tells him that her name isn't really Noodle, only assumed to be, when Scrubit found her in a basket, with an \"N\" on her necklace. On the way out of the zoo, Willy grabs hold of some balloons and floats to the roof of the Gourmet store, where he and Noodle sing and dance, but the police see them. The Chief of police has a conversation with Willy and the two sneak back into the workshop.One of them tells the story of how the Trio have been in cahoots for a long time and he used to work for one (Slugworth), but got fired for snooping around and Willy tells them he is a chocolate maker and his dream of owning the store. That night, Willy passes Noodle her chocolates and the gang have a conversation and agree to help Willy with his dream.The following day, Willy tries out all sorts of new delicious confectionery on the members of the public and the police follow him on bicycles. Eventually, the Chief of police finds a chocolate wrapper and figures out that he has been escaping through the drains in the road. That night, the Chief of police asks the Chocolatiers for more chocolate and they agree. Meanwhile in Willys room, the little orange man comes back, but gets caught in a trap Willy had set and wakes him up. The man tells Willy that he is an Oompa Loompa and he is disappointed at Willy for stealing cocoa beans from Loompaland Land and that he won't go away until he has all the chocolate he requires, before hitting Willy with a frying pan and escaping with the chocolate.The next day, the friends showed Willy the keys to the store and open it up. At first it was a bit of a dump, but they soon got it all up to scratch. The grand opening went really well, until it is revealed that someone had sabotaged the treats and the customers all riot, burning down the store. The others leave Willy alone in the rubble and the three Chocolatiers arrive with a brief case full of money, which they will give to his friends, if he leaves town for good and Willy agrees.

From his father he inherited taste in classical music, and his mother taste in fashion and genteel manners. Dr. Ziegfeld had hoped that his son will takeover the family music reservoir, but after the success of his show in the 1893 World Fair, Flo Ziegfeld was determined to become a showman.Learning from his mistakes in the World Fair, Flo combined attraction with sex appeal and took Sandow the Strong Man on a successful nation-wide tour. After he and Sandow parted ways, Flo was on his way to Europe in search of new talent. He ran into best friend Billings during the crossing.Billings and Flo were both show producers and extremely competitive with each other. Sensing that Billings was in London to sign up a mysterious new talent, the conniving Flo found out who the girl was and put his womanising tricks to their best use. He convinced French singing sensation Anna Held to sign with him instead even though he was down to his last 50 cents.Always living lavishly on borrowed money, Flo managed to built some connections and got enough money to put on the show, but other than commenting on Anna's exceptional beauty, her singing received little attention from the American audience, especially the women. A master publist, Flo had 20 gallons of milk sent to Anna's apartment everyday and purposedly refused to pay the bill. The creditor sued him and Anna's alleged beauty secret - her milk baths - made headlines.

He wanted to produce a show featuring girls, lots of girls; and the stage would be so big that even the audience in the last row would be able to see the performance. Flo sold the idea to Billings, Billings sold it to famous producer Erlanger; and so began 24 years of the Zigfeld Follies.Flo's endless affairs, especially the one with Follies star Audrey Dane, eventually ruined his marriage and Anna divorced him.

When her husband Raymond (Joel Gretsch) informs her that their young son, David, is missing from his room, she washes her hands and neatly folds the towel before joining the search. Eve and Raymond are shown running, with Raymond yelling for David, and ending with Eve crying, screaming for David.A year after the loss of David, Eve and Raymond become the foster parents of a recently orphaned boy named Ethan Snow (Bobby Coleman) and his teenage sister Abby (Jordan Hinson).Abby and Ethan would rather live with Ben Koch (Jason London), a cop who has known them all their lives via his friendship with their parents, and cares deeply about them. He'd love to take them in, if he felt that he was qualified or capable of raising them, but he lives in a one bedroom apartment.Abby and Ethan are soon swept away by the wonderfulness of their new foster parents, and the incredible house that is their new home.Ethan gets his own room with a bathroom close to the master bedroom, but Abby gets the bedroom that's the farthest from Ethan's room, in a part of the house called the tower. A flight of metal stairs outside the tower leads up to the door.The too-good-to-be-true façade begins to crumble as Eve, who seemed kind and compassionate at first, gradually reveals herself to be a domineering, obsessive woman who controls Abby and Ethan's every move, and allows them no freedom whatsoever.There is even a code number that must be dialed before they can make any phone calls, and Abby and Ethan are not told what the code is. Eve even has double locks put on all doors that lead outside.Raymond tells Abby that David had drowned in the lake that the house overlooks. Abby becomes suspicious, especially when she finds an old bed in the basement, and David's name carved on a support post right by it.Ben visits, and Abby begs him to get her and Ethan out of there, but Ben tells her to give it a little more time, saying that he'll take Abby and Ethan to Six Flags in a couple of weeks. When a case worker (Tasha Smith) visits to check up on everything, David's bed is no longer in the basement.What Abby discovers is that Eve is highly unstable. While doting on Ethan, Eve competes with Abby for his love, and develops a spiteful and increasingly violent relationship with Abby as Abby grows more and more rebellious because of her suspicions of Eve and Raymond.The violence starts with Eve slapping Abby for using a four letter word against her. Eve even causes Abby to cut her arm deeply by deliberately leaving already-broken glasses in a sink full of dishes that she tells Abby to wash.The dishes were covered by a thick layer of soap bubbles, so Abby didn't see the broken glasses. Eve, who used to be a nurse, stitches the wound, deliberately making the process as painful as possible. And she injects Abby with something. Abby later wakes up, feeling not-so-good, and Eve tells Abby that she was in bed for three days.When Ethan comes down with a mysterious illness that Eve insists on treating at home, Abby is suspicious that Eve is spiking Ethan's food with something in order to make him sick.Ethan grows sicker by the day, and both of their lives are in grave danger as Eve grows more and more unstable. Abby insists that Eve take Ethan to the hospital, but Eve refuses.Abby searches the Internet for information, and learns about Munchausen syndrome by proxy. Abby is horrified to realize that Eve's behavior perfectly fits every symptom that's listed on the website -- including the one that says that those who have Munchausen syndrome by proxy are skilled deceivers. The site even says \"Suspects should be considered even more dangerous once they believe they are suspected.\"Abby tries to use the computer to send an e-mail, but that feature has been blocked, so she tries to use it to dial 911, but that has also been blocked.When Abby talks to Raymond, he tells her that David was a foster child, like she and Ethan are. Abby is deeply disturbed that the picture of David that Raymond is holding is not the same picture she found during an earlier visit to David's bedroom.Abby once again goes to David's bedroom, where she finds a picture drawn by a boy named Tyler, and learns of the existence of another boy named Alexsei. Abby grabs some pictures of them as evidence.It seems that Munchausen syndrome by proxy has led to Eve killing a number of foster sons. Abby realizes that she and Ethan have to save themselves from Eve before she can kill them.Abby gets Ethan, who is still sick, outside of the house and inside of a car, and then Abby sees Raymond returning home. Abby rushes Ethan back to his bedroom. Abby promises Ethan that she'll go get Ben, and bring him back with her.In a hallway, a furious Eve finds Abby, and shakes her, causing the pictures to drop to the floor. Eve viciously smacks Abby, drags her into the nearby attic, kicks her to the floor, and locks her in.After a while, Eve brings some food to Abby, and leaves. Abby thinks it might be spiked with whatever's making Ethan sick. Later, Eve comes back in and tells Abby that if she doesn't eat, then Eve will never let Abby out of the room.Later, Eve leaves another meal in the room, and walks away. Abby grabs a screwdriver, and starts trying to pry off the board that covers the window. Later, Eve injects Ethan with something, and then she sprays heavy-duty oven cleaner on his back to make it look like a rash has appeared.Abby pries the board off, and she sees Ben pulling in. Raymond comes in, and tells Abby that if she makes one sound, he'll kill Ben. Raymond answers the door and tries to make an excuse to keep Ben from coming in, but Ben wants to come in and look around. Ben asks where Ethan's room is, and Raymond leads him to a bedroom that no one is in.Ben, who is becoming suspicious, decides to leave, and Abby is trying to pry the window opened, and she manages to cut away a small section of glass. Raymond, who heard the sound of the piece of glass dropping, goes back in and tells Eve that Ben left.Abby breaks out the rest of the window, and gets out of the attic. Abby goes to Ethan's room, and Eve, listening via an intercom, hears Abby telling Ethan that they're getting out of there.Eve goes to the kitchen, grabs a meat cleaver, and goes to Ethan's room, but she doesn't see Abby. Eve starts searching for Abby, who goes outside. Eve goes out onto a balcony, and sees Abby. The phone starts ringing, and Eve gets to it first. It's Ben, who immediately hangs up.Ben, who is just down the hill from the house, has started suspecting Eve and Raymond of child endangerment, so he called to make sure they're home. Ben alerts his colleagues at the LAPD. Over the house's intercom, Eve tells Abby that she's not going anywhere.Abby goes out to the garage, and starts up the SUV, but she gets out of it so she can open the garage door. Raymond grabs her, throws her down, and tells her that she just can't leave.Abby hits Raymond on the head with a wrench, knocking him out. Abby runs, and Eve finds Raymond out cold. Eve turns off the SUV, and takes the keys. Eve walks away.Ben finds Raymond out cold. Ben goes inside, and Eve stabs him in the neck with a hypodermic needle, injecting him with something that makes him collapse. Abby goes back to Ethan's room, and he's not there.Abby hides under the bed when she hears Eve coming. Eve doesn't find Abby in the room, so Eve leaves to continue searching. Abby gets out from under the bed. Eve goes to Abby's room, and Abby hears her telling Ethan to stay there.After Eve leaves Abby's room, Abby heads to the room, and doesn't see Ethan there. Eve has tricked Abby into coming out of hiding. Eve comes in with the cleaver, and they struggle with each other. Abby forces the cleaver out of Eve's hand.They end up on the landing at the top of the stairs to the room, where Eve tries to push Abby over the railing. But Abby knocks Eve down the metal stairs, and Eve takes a blow to the head.Ben wakes up, and he sees the needle that Eve stabbed him with. Abby finds Ethan in a bathtub of hot water, with his face partially submerged. That's how Eve made it look like David drowned in the lake.With the bathtub filling, Abby gets Ethan out of the tub, and realizes that he's conscious -- he didn't breathe in much water at all. Eve comes up behind Abby, who screams.Eve knocks Abby to the floor, and raises the cleaver. Ben enters with a gun. Before Eve can hit Abby with the cleaver, and before Ben can fire his gun, someone else fires a shot that kills Eve.It was Raymond who fired the shot. It seems that the reason why Raymond reluctantly helped Eve is because he was so blinded by his love for her. Raymond is arrested for his part in endangering Abby and Ethan.Abby and Ben ride to the hospital in the ambulance with Ethan. They'll be living with Ben.","description_full":"Eve Goode (Angie Harmon), who lives in an isolated Spanish-style house not far from Los Angeles, cleans her oven.

Eve and Raymond are shown running, with Raymond yelling for David, and ending with Eve crying, screaming for David.A year after the loss of David, Eve and Raymond become the foster parents of a recently orphaned boy named Ethan Snow (Bobby Coleman) and his teenage sister Abby (Jordan Hinson).Abby and Ethan would rather live with Ben Koch (Jason London), a cop who has known them all their lives via his friendship with their parents, and cares deeply about them. He'd love to take them in, if he felt that he was qualified or capable of raising them, but he lives in a one bedroom apartment.Abby and Ethan are soon swept away by the wonderfulness of their new foster parents, and the incredible house that is their new home.Ethan gets his own room with a bathroom close to the master bedroom, but Abby gets the bedroom that's the farthest from Ethan's room, in a part of the house called the tower. A flight of metal stairs outside the tower leads up to the door.The too-good-to-be-true façade begins to crumble as Eve, who seemed kind and compassionate at first, gradually reveals herself to be a domineering, obsessive woman who controls Abby and Ethan's every move, and allows them no freedom whatsoever.There is even a code number that must be dialed before they can make any phone calls, and Abby and Ethan are not told what the code is. Eve even has double locks put on all doors that lead outside.Raymond tells Abby that David had drowned in the lake that the house overlooks. Abby becomes suspicious, especially when she finds an old bed in the basement, and David's name carved on a support post right by it.Ben visits, and Abby begs him to get her and Ethan out of there, but Ben tells her to give it a little more time, saying that he'll take Abby and Ethan to Six Flags in a couple of weeks. When a case worker (Tasha Smith) visits to check up on everything, David's bed is no longer in the basement.What Abby discovers is that Eve is highly unstable. While doting on Ethan, Eve competes with Abby for his love, and develops a spiteful and increasingly violent relationship with Abby as Abby grows more and more rebellious because of her suspicions of Eve and Raymond.The violence starts with Eve slapping Abby for using a four letter word against her. Eve even causes Abby to cut her arm deeply by deliberately leaving already-broken glasses in a sink full of dishes that she tells Abby to wash.The dishes were covered by a thick layer of soap bubbles, so Abby didn't see the broken glasses. Eve, who used to be a nurse, stitches the wound, deliberately making the process as painful as possible. And she injects Abby with something. Abby later wakes up, feeling not-so-good, and Eve tells Abby that she was in bed for three days.When Ethan comes down with a mysterious illness that Eve insists on treating at home, Abby is suspicious that Eve is spiking Ethan's food with something in order to make him sick.Ethan grows sicker by the day, and both of their lives are in grave danger as Eve grows more and more unstable. Abby insists that Eve take Ethan to the hospital, but Eve refuses.Abby searches the Internet for information, and learns about Munchausen syndrome by proxy. Abby is horrified to realize that Eve's behavior perfectly fits every symptom that's listed on the website -- including the one that says that those who have Munchausen syndrome by proxy are skilled deceivers. The site even says \"Suspects should be considered even more dangerous once they believe they are suspected.\"Abby tries to use the computer to send an e-mail, but that feature has been blocked, so she tries to use it to dial 911, but that has also been blocked.When Abby talks to Raymond, he tells her that David was a foster child, like she and Ethan are. Abby is deeply disturbed that the picture of David that Raymond is holding is not the same picture she found during an earlier visit to David's bedroom.Abby once again goes to David's bedroom, where she finds a picture drawn by a boy named Tyler, and learns of the existence of another boy named Alexsei. Abby grabs some pictures of them as evidence.It seems that Munchausen syndrome by proxy has led to Eve killing a number of foster sons. Abby realizes that she and Ethan have to save themselves from Eve before she can kill them.Abby gets Ethan, who is still sick, outside of the house and inside of a car, and then Abby sees Raymond returning home. Abby rushes Ethan back to his bedroom. Abby promises Ethan that she'll go get Ben, and bring him back with her.In a hallway, a furious Eve finds Abby, and shakes her, causing the pictures to drop to the floor. Eve viciously smacks Abby, drags her into the nearby attic, kicks her to the floor, and locks her in.After a while, Eve brings some food to Abby, and leaves. Abby thinks it might be spiked with whatever's making Ethan sick. Later, Eve comes back in and tells Abby that if she doesn't eat, then Eve will never let Abby out of the room.Later, Eve leaves another meal in the room, and walks away. Abby grabs a screwdriver, and starts trying to pry off the board that covers the window. Later, Eve injects Ethan with something, and then she sprays heavy-duty oven cleaner on his back to make it look like a rash has appeared.Abby pries the board off, and she sees Ben pulling in. Raymond comes in, and tells Abby that if she makes one sound, he'll kill Ben. Raymond answers the door and tries to make an excuse to keep Ben from coming in, but Ben wants to come in and look around. Ben asks where Ethan's room is, and Raymond leads him to a bedroom that no one is in.Ben, who is becoming suspicious, decides to leave, and Abby is trying to pry the window opened, and she manages to cut away a small section of glass. Raymond, who heard the sound of the piece of glass dropping, goes back in and tells Eve that Ben left.Abby breaks out the rest of the window, and gets out of the attic. Abby goes to Ethan's room, and Eve, listening via an intercom, hears Abby telling Ethan that they're getting out of there.Eve goes to the kitchen, grabs a meat cleaver, and goes to Ethan's room, but she doesn't see Abby. Eve starts searching for Abby, who goes outside. Eve goes out onto a balcony, and sees Abby. The phone starts ringing, and Eve gets to it first. It's Ben, who immediately hangs up.Ben, who is just down the hill from the house, has started suspecting Eve and Raymond of child endangerment, so he called to make sure they're home. Ben alerts his colleagues at the LAPD. Over the house's intercom, Eve tells Abby that she's not going anywhere.Abby goes out to the garage, and starts up the SUV, but she gets out of it so she can open the garage door. Raymond grabs her, throws her down, and tells her that she just can't leave.Abby hits Raymond on the head with a wrench, knocking him out. Abby runs, and Eve finds Raymond out cold. Eve turns off the SUV, and takes the keys. Eve walks away.Ben finds Raymond out cold. Ben goes inside, and Eve stabs him in the neck with a hypodermic needle, injecting him with something that makes him collapse. Abby goes back to Ethan's room, and he's not there.Abby hides under the bed when she hears Eve coming. Eve doesn't find Abby in the room, so Eve leaves to continue searching. Abby gets out from under the bed. Eve goes to Abby's room, and Abby hears her telling Ethan to stay there.After Eve leaves Abby's room, Abby heads to the room, and doesn't see Ethan there. Eve has tricked Abby into coming out of hiding. Eve comes in with the cleaver, and they struggle with each other. Abby forces the cleaver out of Eve's hand.They end up on the landing at the top of the stairs to the room, where Eve tries to push Abby over the railing. But Abby knocks Eve down the metal stairs, and Eve takes a blow to the head.Ben wakes up, and he sees the needle that Eve stabbed him with. Abby finds Ethan in a bathtub of hot water, with his face partially submerged. That's how Eve made it look like David drowned in the lake.With the bathtub filling, Abby gets Ethan out of the tub, and realizes that he's conscious -- he didn't breathe in much water at all. Eve comes up behind Abby, who screams.Eve knocks Abby to the floor, and raises the cleaver. Ben enters with a gun. Before Eve can hit Abby with the cleaver, and before Ben can fire his gun, someone else fires a shot that kills Eve.It was Raymond who fired the shot. It seems that the reason why Raymond reluctantly helped Eve is because he was so blinded by his love for her. Raymond is arrested for his part in endangering Abby and Ethan.Abby and Ben ride to the hospital in the ambulance with Ethan.

Their behavior causes the actress (Tanushree Dutta) to run away. This really upsets the organizer, who offered the chance mainly because of the heroine. After reaching London, Champak tells the duo that whoever gets a new actress will get to become hero. Then Babla asks Gulab Singh Lakhan Singh Haryanewale (Rajpal Yadav), a local driver where he can find a heroine. Gulab Singh misinterprets this as prostitute and directs him to a park.Bunty, who has heard everything, follows them. In a misunderstanding, they meet two men from underworld and exchange their goods, only to find that the men have sold drugs to them since the underworld misinterpreted their need for heroine as \"heroin\". Bunty convinces Babla into going to the police to turn in the drugs to get good credit or an award, but the police get the wrong impression and think they are drug dealers. Commissioner JD Mehra (Jackie Shroff) releases them after telling them not to leave the country until they are proven innocent. Then while search of a heroine, Bunty and Gulab Singh take help of Guru (Shakti Kapoor), a local don who is a drunkard and they end up breaking his (Guru's) legs. Guru sends his goons to thrash Bunty and Gulab Singh but they escape. They bump into Munni (Lara Dutta), who is trying to commit suicide. Bunty saves her and brings her to the theatre group to be the heroine.Later, Bunty falls in love with Munni, but then she has an accident. The doctor notes that she may have suicidal tendencies. When Munni wakes up, she claims to be Nisha Chauhan, wife of Vikram Chauhan (Arbaaz Khan). They meet Vikram, who confirms her suicidal nature. A heartbroken Bunty accepts the fact and tries to forget her, only to learn some time later that Nisha has burnt herself to death.Meanwhile, the underworld don (Sharat Saxena) who gave drugs and his boss M.G. Gandhi (Manoj Joshi) think that Bunty, Babla and Champak are undercover cops and they want to kill them. However, Bunty suddenly spots Nisha in the city one day. Later, Champak and Babla too see her. On the day of the drama, the trio see Vikram flailing a gun at someone and are shocked to see him die in front of them.All three are frightened and throw his body down a vent. During the performance, Vikram's body falls from the ceiling. Mehra questions everyone and arrests the trio for murder of Vikram. M.G. Gandhi wants the three dead because he thinks they're going to get him thrown in jail. Gandhi's men attack the police car transporting the trio, helping them to escape. The trio try to search priety based on the clues they have. Meanwhile, Gulab Singh is given task by Guru to search for the trio. M G Gandhi captures Champak. Bunty and Babla run into Nisha, well and alive, upon which they trap her at the clock tower of Brighton railway station.It is revealed her real name is Aditi and she was hired by Vikram to play his wife Nisha and convince people she is crazy in return for money and a passport out of the UK. Vikram wanted to kill his real wife Nisha (Gurleen Chopra) to get her wealth. When Aditi found out about his ways, she tried to stop him and failed. She later tried to reach Bunty at the show to tell him about it, but Vikram caught her. Then Mehra arrived at the play and killed Vikram. Just then, Mehra arrives there and confirms that he is indeed Vikram's killer.Mehra reveals that Nisha was his sister and he killed Vikram to avenge her murder. He also intends to kill Aditi as she helped Vikram to pass off Nisha's murder as suicide.The disaster is averted due to an accident.Bunty tries to stop Mehra, saying that Aditi wanted to say something in her defense, but she remains tongue-tied due to fear.

Hakka flees towards his master on spotting Gandhi and his men coming with Champak leaving Ravinder. Gandhi mistakes Ravinder as Sherkhan, a drug dealer from whom he used to buy drugs, ending up in annoying Ravinder. Meanwhile, Gulab Singh's employer (who had leased him a taxi) and Hakka, with his friends, enter the scene. Briefed wrongly due to misinterpreting by his men all those who were present as undercover cops, Gandhi fires his pistol towards the ceiling. All reach where Babla, Bunty, Mehra and Aditi stand. Gandhi, again due to incorrect briefing, fires at Mehra, but misses and the bullets pierce a beehive. The honeybees launch an attack, in standing against which everyone loses its head. Mehra flees the scene unhurt, and probably also calls the police.Some climb on the top of the tower, while Bunty breaks the dial of the clock. All cling to the front of the clock while a firefighting crane arrives. The firefighter allows only two people, but everybody holds the crane, overloading and throwing it out of order. The victims are thrown off the crane seconds after they hold it. The first is an Arab(possibly Sherkhan in disguise); he runs head and feet first into a Time Magazine poster.

His man falls into white paint. Gandhi emerges out tied to a rocket amidst deafening explosions. He, too, has a dive in the reservoir of a fountain. Champak slides down, ruining a set table. He is taken along by an oncoming Babla into a trashcan. The last to be thrown off the crane is Gulab Singh, who rests on the hands of a statue. The crane then falls apart.

Bunty and Babla run into Nisha, well and alive, upon which they trap her at the clock tower of Brighton railway station.It is revealed her real name is Aditi and she was hired by Vikram to play his wife Nisha and convince people she is crazy in return for money and a passport out of the UK. Vikram wanted to kill his real wife Nisha (Gurleen Chopra) to get her wealth. When Aditi found out about his ways, she tried to stop him and failed. She later tried to reach Bunty at the show to tell him about it, but Vikram caught her. Then Mehra arrived at the play and killed Vikram. Just then, Mehra arrives there and confirms that he is indeed Vikram's killer.Mehra reveals that Nisha was his sister and he killed Vikram to avenge her murder. He also intends to kill Aditi as she helped Vikram to pass off Nisha's murder as suicide.The disaster is averted due to an accident.Bunty tries to stop Mehra, saying that Aditi wanted to say something in her defense, but she remains tongue-tied due to fear. Guru and his men take Gulab Singh to the clock, leaving Hakka, Guru's right hand to take care of Ravinder Taneja, the sponsor. Hakka flees towards his master on spotting Gandhi and his men coming with Champak leaving Ravinder. Gandhi mistakes Ravinder as Sherkhan, a drug dealer from whom he used to buy drugs, ending up in annoying Ravinder. Meanwhile, Gulab Singh's employer (who had leased him a taxi) and Hakka, with his friends, enter the scene. Briefed wrongly due to misinterpreting by his men all those who were present as undercover cops, Gandhi fires his pistol towards the ceiling. All reach where Babla, Bunty, Mehra and Aditi stand. Gandhi, again due to incorrect briefing, fires at Mehra, but misses and the bullets pierce a beehive. The honeybees launch an attack, in standing against which everyone loses its head. Mehra flees the scene unhurt, and probably also calls the police.Some climb on the top of the tower, while Bunty breaks the dial of the clock. All cling to the front of the clock while a firefighting crane arrives. The firefighter allows only two people, but everybody holds the crane, overloading and throwing it out of order. The victims are thrown off the crane seconds after they hold it. The first is an Arab(possibly Sherkhan in disguise); he runs head and feet first into a Time Magazine poster. A British drug dealer (who works for Gandhi) then crashes into a window of a nearby building. Bunty and Aditi then land on a hanging poster. Aditi is saved but Bunty falls down. Ravinder lands into the reservoir of a fountain, ingesting a marine animal on reaching underwater. Gulab Singh's employer, Hakka and Guru fall on a palm tree. Gandhi, his other man and Champak land on a live overhead electric line. Hakka drops down onto bouquets displayed under the tree. Guru, hanging on a rope or the line, transports in and disrupts the Pampered Pet Shop. Those on the line get thrown due to electric current. Gandhi lands in a firecracker store. His man falls into white paint. Gandhi emerges out tied to a rocket amidst deafening explosions. He, too, has a dive in the reservoir of a fountain. Champak slides down, ruining a set table. He is taken along by an oncoming Babla into a trashcan. The last to be thrown off the crane is Gulab Singh, who rests on the hands of a statue. The crane then falls apart. When in the hospital, Mehra returns the passports of Babla, Bunty and Champak. Then, he surrenders to his juniors.","yt_trailer_code":"ihCaohTJYCo","language":"hi","mpa_rating":"","background_image":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/bhagam_bhag_2006/background.jpg","background_image_original":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/bhagam_bhag_2006/background.jpg","small_cover_image":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/bhagam_bhag_2006/small-cover.jpg","medium_cover_image":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/bhagam_bhag_2006/medium-cover.jpg","large_cover_image":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/bhagam_bhag_2006/large-cover.jpg","state":"ok","torrents":[{"url":"https://yts.mx/torrent/download/0CF74D516C12AF5E18F871CC48489756799E8D05","hash":"0CF74D516C12AF5E18F871CC48489756799E8D05","quality":"720p","type":"bluray","is_repack":"0","video_codec":"x264","bit_depth":"8","audio_channels":"2.0","seeds":15,"peers":6,"size":"1.43 GB","size_bytes":1535450808,"date_uploaded":"2024-01-31 12:31:03","date_uploaded_unix":1706700663},{"url":"https://yts.mx/torrent/download/01A5FFB2EB7BB515FA1C903DDB59474FAF5FFCBA","hash":"01A5FFB2EB7BB515FA1C903DDB59474FAF5FFCBA","quality":"1080p","type":"bluray","is_repack":"0","video_codec":"x264","bit_depth":"8","audio_channels":"5.1","seeds":23,"peers":6,"size":"2.93 GB","size_bytes":3146063544,"date_uploaded":"2024-01-31 14:30:45","date_uploaded_unix":1706707845}],"date_uploaded":"2024-01-31 12:31:03","date_uploaded_unix":1706700663},{"id":59529,"url":"https://yts.mx/movies/st-ives-1976","imdb_code":"tt0075263","title":"St. Ives","title_english":"St. Ives","title_long":"St. Ives (1976)","slug":"st-ives-1976","year":1976,"rating":6.2,"runtime":0,"genres":["Action","Crime","Drama","Mystery","Thriller"],"summary":"Abner Procane, top Los Angeles burglar, finds that somebody stole his plans for his next ambitious heist.

As a result, the overprotective King Marcus and Queen Elvina forbid her from going skating ever again.Annoyed, Annika sneaks out to join a skating festival in the village that night. A powerful sorcerer named Wenlock appears and orders the princess to marry him. Marcus and Elvina arrive and confront Wenlock, but he laughs and cryptically reminds Marcus and Elvina of the fate of their \"other daughter\". When Annika refuses his proposal, Wenlock petrifies the entire village population, including Annika's parents. Annika is rescued by a winged horse named Brietta, but Wenlock warns her she has three days to marry him; otherwise, the spell will become permanent.Brietta takes Annika to the Cloud Kingdom, ruled by Queen Rayla. Annika discovers that her parents' \"other daughter\" is, in fact, Brietta, who was transformed into a pegasus by Wenlock when she refused to marry him. This explains why their parents were so protective of Annika once she was born. The Cloud Queen tells Annika that the only thing that can defeat Wenlock is a \"Wand of Light\"; built from a measure of courage, a ring of love, and a gem of ice lit by hope's eternal flame. Despite Brietta's reluctance due to past failed attempts, Annika assures her that they can build the wand together.Annika, Brietta, and Shiver travel to the Forbidden Forest, where they meet Aidan, a blacksmith. When Shiver and Annika fall into a giant's stew pot, Annika uses her hair ribbon to help them escape. The ribbon, Annika's exact height, is the \"measure of courage\", and turns into a staff for the Wand of Light. After getting a map from the gem dealer Ferris, the group finds a large cavern filled with ice gems, where Annika and Aidan take one each. Aidan reveals that he ran away from his parents after he lost all of their money gambling. He took an extra gem to bring to his parents, so they would forgive him. Brietta offers her tiara for the ring of love.

A rock tumbles on a collision course with Earth. The pulsating blue rock lands on an island off the east coast of Africa. It cools to a light rusty brown. The Warburton Oil Resources Company has a small construction crew on the island preparing the site for an oil exploration operation. Lloyd Kelly (Clint Walker) is driving a jeep to check on progress. He passes Chub Foster (Neville Brand), a maintenance mechanic pumping fuel into a pickup truck. He passes Dennis Holvig (Carl Betz) operating a large, orange Bucket Shovel. He stops near an idled Catepillar Grader. Beltran (James T. Watson Jr.) is sitting on the fender. Kelly asks, \"What's the hang up, Beltran?\" Seems the Grader needs the assistance of a D9 Bulldozer to get him up a hill but it hasn't shown up to assist. Kelly calls Mac on the radio, but there is no answer. McCarthy (Robert Urich) is with Dutch Krasner (James Wainwright) checking out an abandoned building. The island was a refueling station during World War II. The island is six square miles in size and two hundred miles off the coast of Africa. Kelly drives off in search of his missing man. Kelly finds McCarthy and Dutch rummaging through an abandoned locker. The crew has five days left to prepare a base camp for an oil drilling operation. McCarthy climbs aboard his Catepillar D9 Bulldozer. Kelly orders Dutch to go and help Beltran building the access road. McCarthy aims the D9 towards his objective and commands, \"Ok, sweetheart, destroy.\" Title and credits roll over the demolition of the old Quonset hut by the Bulldozer. McCarthy gets off his rig to examine a metallic rock. He is unable to dislodge it. Kelly offers to show the younger man how to handle the Bulldozer. Mac hears a humming sound coming from the rock. Kelly gets a running start, but the rock won't budge. The rock begins to glow a bright electric blue, then transfers its energy into the blade of the D9. A flash of light knocks McCarthy to the ground. Kelly jumps off the D9 to assist the fallen man.In their tent that evening, Dutch, Dennis and Beltran discuss McCarthy's condition and Kelly's unreasonable push to complete work on the island. Kelly calls company headquarters on their radio for help. McCarthy lays on his cot, severely burned, his arm wrapped in bandages. Mac wants to talk to Kelly alone. The other men exit the tent, but Dennis holds back just outside. Mac asks, \"Did you see it? I don't know exactly. When you hit the rock, blue. Whatever it was, you must have seen it.\" Kelly denies seeing anything. Struggling to breathe, Mac tells Kelly, \"Blue light. It's there in the blade.\" Mac dies. Dennis, standing just outside the tent hears the entire exchange. Kelly informs Dutch and Beltran that Mac is dead and they will have to bury him temporarily. Kelly goes out to examine the Bulldozer. He climbs aboard and starts it. He is surprised when it seems to have a mind of its own. Unable to control the machine, he cuts a fuel line, but the D9 chases after him after he falls to the ground. Before it has a chance to crush Kelly, the D9 just stops. All except Kelly are present for an impromptu graveside service on the beach for Mac. Dutch was very close friend to Mac, and is especially angry with Kelly. He blames Kelly for Mac's death. Kelly drags the D9 back to camp using the Grader as a tow truck. Dennis tells the others that Kelly is a former alcoholic and this job is pretty much his last chance. Kelly was injured on the D9. In his tent he is talking to Chub while dressing the burn on his arm. He directs Chub to look over the D9 and tell him what was wrong with it. Dennis Holvig goes out for a cigarette next to the Bulldozer. The D9's headlights come on and the blade starts to slowly rise. The blade quickly drops startling Dennis.The next morning Kelly is back on the radio providing headquarters his daily status report. Chub is working on the D9 and outlines his findings to Kelly. Chub makes Kelly aware of the weird humming coming from the blade. Kelly goes into Dennis Holvig's tent to roust him back to work. Dennis wants to discuss the \"blue light\" first. Before Dennis leaves the tent he reports to Kelly, \"Still last night I wondered. I could have sworn that D9 blade moved. It almost took my foot off.\" While Chub is working on the generator, Beltran boards the D9 and starts it up. Chub orders him off the D9, per Kelly's strict orders for no one to operate it. Beltran pretends not to hear the mechanic. Beltran drives off, then notices that the machine will not respond to command inputs. The wayward machine crushes the radio then heads off into the brush. Kelly gives chase in the jeep. The D9 continues through the brush despite Beltran's best efforts to control the mechanical beast. Beltran jumps off the D9. The bulldozer turns towards the man and chases him through the underbrush. Beltran crawls into a piece of loose galvanized drainage pipe, but the D9 rolls over it killing him. He is buried next to Mac, and then there were four.The four remaining men gather in Kelly's tent to talk while the D9 waits somewhere on the island to kill again. Dennis shaves while Dutch paces around in their tent. Dutch wants to go out for a midnight swim, but instead sits on his cot listening to music. Dennis goes outside and talks to Kelly. He asks exactly what happened to Beltran. Kelly replies, \"The D9 was operating by itself when it ran him down - throttling, pivoting, floating the blade.\" Dennis slips out of the tent for a walk. It is dark now and he sees for himself the D9 prowling around. It flashes its headlights, then moves towards the man. Dennis runs back to camp and the D9 continues to plow under wood pilings.The next morning Kelly is having breakfast. He pours a cup of coffee when Dennis enters the kitchen tent. He flatly proclaims to Kelly, \"I don't believe Mac was delirious. I saw the D9 operating all by itself. You saw it too, didn't you when it got Beltran?\" Dennis hands Kelly a piece of the rock that started it all. Both agree it's a metallic meteorite. Dennis finally convinces Kelly the D9 must be destroyed. He suggests dynamite. Near camp, Chub and Dutch are refueling the Grader. Dutch tells Chub that they are both likely to join the other two buried near the beach. Kelly and Dennis pull up in the jeep and the four men witness the rogue D9 destroy their camp, tents and all. The four men head up to higher ground and watch the D9 systematically destroy everything in camp. The D9 sits out in the brush as the men survey the damage to camp. Dennis reports that there is enough canned food and water for a couple days - enough until the supply ship arrives in a few days. Dutch finally has his answer, \"Remote control. That's got to be it. That thing is running by remote control.\" Dutch suggests to Kelly and Dennis that someone else must be on the island operating the D9. Kelly decides the four should head for higher ground. They take the two jeeps and the pickup truck. The D9 starts up and follows the men. The pickup truck can't make it up the grade. The men split up. Kelly and Chub explore the higher ground. From the top of the hill Kelly spots the D9 coming up a ravine. Kelly and Chub pile some kindling and douse it with gasoline. Their plan is to build a signal fire in hope of attracting a boat or airplane. They drive away after lighting the fire. Chub has an idea. He suggests ramming the pickup into the bulldozer. All the fuel barrels on the truck will catch fire and that should destroy any rubber parts and melt the electrical wiring. The D9 destroys the signal fire. The D9 ambushes the men. It destroys the pickup truck. Dutch was able to jump free, but Chub was unable to exit the truck before the D9 destroys it. And then there were three graves next to the beach. Dutch is convinced the D9 knew the plan. He tells Kelly, \"It knew. That ambush. It knew what we were gonna do and it did it first.\" Both Dennis and Kelly think Dutch is losing it. The D9's next move is to plow a pile of rocks down on the men on the beach. One rock strikes Dennis. At the second rock fall the three men drive off in the orange jeep. The men wait in a ravine while the D9 lurks in the bushes. They can hear it, but they can't see the hellish thing. They decide to leave.That night Dutch paces back and forth nervously. He notes the sound of the surf. He returns to his midnight swim idea. He asks Dennis, \"What's it doing out there?\" To calm Dutch's frayed nerves, Kelly gives him a bottle of alcohol and suggests he take a nap. The next morning we see an empty liquor bottle and a very drunk Dutch. He drives the jeep off and proclaims, \"I'm going swimming.\" He runs straight into the waiting D9. They face off in a sandy clearing. The D9 heads straight for Dutch, who naturally has trouble starting the jeep engine. The D9 quickly turns the jeep into a 6-inch thick pile of scrap. And then there were two. The D9 chases Kelly and Dennis, who are now on foot. They spot and then run to the Shovel. The D9 backs away to get a running start to attack the Shovel. The D9 jousts with the Shovel, skillfully operated by Dennis. It tries a couple of different angles, but the two machines seem evenly matched. Dennis gets the bucket under the bulldozer's blade, but the strain snaps a cable. The men run to the Grader. They finally deduce that the machine can't be killed, but the entity controlling it can be, but with what? In answer to the question how do you kill a killer, Dennis remarks, \"It's too heavy to hang. It's too big to fit in a gas chamber.\" It is Kelly who suggests electricity - electrocution. They proceed to rig a trap using the generator and metal grating. They plan to use the Grader as bait to lure the D9 onto the grating, which is covered with brown tarps as camouflage. The D9 approaches Kelly, who is now sitting in the Grader. The D9 stops just short of the trap. The D9 turns to face the generator and Dennis standing behind it. Kelly grabs a crowbar and walks over to the monster and taunts it. A well-aimed throw of the crowbar takes out one of the headlights which infuriates the bulldozer. It makes straight for Kelly and right over the trap. Dennis throws the generator switch and fries the machine. It howls and thrashes and lifts and lowers the blade in its death throes. The blade turns a bright blue, then violet. The blade returns to normal color and the humming stops. It would appear to be dead and the two men cautiously approach the D9. Dennis suggests a plausible story to tell the company about the four men dying in a landslide, but Kelly insists on the truth - hard as it will be to explain or believe. Both agree they are glad to be alive. Kelly tosses his red hardhat up in the air. It lands on the D9. End Credits roll over a freeze frame of the D9 and Kelly's hardhat.","description_full":"This 1974 made for TV movie opens out in space. A rock tumbles on a collision course with Earth.

He passes Chub Foster (Neville Brand), a maintenance mechanic pumping fuel into a pickup truck. He passes Dennis Holvig (Carl Betz) operating a large, orange Bucket Shovel. He stops near an idled Catepillar Grader. Beltran (James T. Watson Jr.) is sitting on the fender. Kelly asks, \"What's the hang up, Beltran?\" Seems the Grader needs the assistance of a D9 Bulldozer to get him up a hill but it hasn't shown up to assist. Kelly calls Mac on the radio, but there is no answer. McCarthy (Robert Urich) is with Dutch Krasner (James Wainwright) checking out an abandoned building. The island was a refueling station during World War II. The island is six square miles in size and two hundred miles off the coast of Africa. Kelly drives off in search of his missing man. Kelly finds McCarthy and Dutch rummaging through an abandoned locker. The crew has five days left to prepare a base camp for an oil drilling operation. McCarthy climbs aboard his Catepillar D9 Bulldozer. Kelly orders Dutch to go and help Beltran building the access road. McCarthy aims the D9 towards his objective and commands, \"Ok, sweetheart, destroy.\" Title and credits roll over the demolition of the old Quonset hut by the Bulldozer. McCarthy gets off his rig to examine a metallic rock. He is unable to dislodge it. Kelly offers to show the younger man how to handle the Bulldozer. Mac hears a humming sound coming from the rock. Kelly gets a running start, but the rock won't budge. The rock begins to glow a bright electric blue, then transfers its energy into the blade of the D9. A flash of light knocks McCarthy to the ground. Kelly jumps off the D9 to assist the fallen man.In their tent that evening, Dutch, Dennis and Beltran discuss McCarthy's condition and Kelly's unreasonable push to complete work on the island. Kelly calls company headquarters on their radio for help. McCarthy lays on his cot, severely burned, his arm wrapped in bandages. Mac wants to talk to Kelly alone. The other men exit the tent, but Dennis holds back just outside. Mac asks, \"Did you see it? I don't know exactly. When you hit the rock, blue. Whatever it was, you must have seen it.\" Kelly denies seeing anything. Struggling to breathe, Mac tells Kelly, \"Blue light. It's there in the blade.\" Mac dies. Dennis, standing just outside the tent hears the entire exchange. Kelly informs Dutch and Beltran that Mac is dead and they will have to bury him temporarily. Kelly goes out to examine the Bulldozer. He climbs aboard and starts it. He is surprised when it seems to have a mind of its own. Unable to control the machine, he cuts a fuel line, but the D9 chases after him after he falls to the ground. Before it has a chance to crush Kelly, the D9 just stops. All except Kelly are present for an impromptu graveside service on the beach for Mac. Dutch was very close friend to Mac, and is especially angry with Kelly. He blames Kelly for Mac's death. Kelly drags the D9 back to camp using the Grader as a tow truck. Dennis tells the others that Kelly is a former alcoholic and this job is pretty much his last chance. Kelly was injured on the D9. In his tent he is talking to Chub while dressing the burn on his arm. He directs Chub to look over the D9 and tell him what was wrong with it. Dennis Holvig goes out for a cigarette next to the Bulldozer. The D9's headlights come on and the blade starts to slowly rise. The blade quickly drops startling Dennis.The next morning Kelly is back on the radio providing headquarters his daily status report. Chub is working on the D9 and outlines his findings to Kelly. Chub makes Kelly aware of the weird humming coming from the blade. Kelly goes into Dennis Holvig's tent to roust him back to work. Dennis wants to discuss the \"blue light\" first. Before Dennis leaves the tent he reports to Kelly, \"Still last night I wondered. I could have sworn that D9 blade moved. It almost took my foot off.\" While Chub is working on the generator, Beltran boards the D9 and starts it up. Chub orders him off the D9, per Kelly's strict orders for no one to operate it. Beltran pretends not to hear the mechanic. Beltran drives off, then notices that the machine will not respond to command inputs. The wayward machine crushes the radio then heads off into the brush. Kelly gives chase in the jeep. The D9 continues through the brush despite Beltran's best efforts to control the mechanical beast. Beltran jumps off the D9. The bulldozer turns towards the man and chases him through the underbrush. Beltran crawls into a piece of loose galvanized drainage pipe, but the D9 rolls over it killing him. He is buried next to Mac, and then there were four.The four remaining men gather in Kelly's tent to talk while the D9 waits somewhere on the island to kill again. Dennis shaves while Dutch paces around in their tent. Dutch wants to go out for a midnight swim, but instead sits on his cot listening to music. Dennis goes outside and talks to Kelly. He asks exactly what happened to Beltran. Kelly replies, \"The D9 was operating by itself when it ran him down - throttling, pivoting, floating the blade.\" Dennis slips out of the tent for a walk. It is dark now and he sees for himself the D9 prowling around. It flashes its headlights, then moves towards the man. Dennis runs back to camp and the D9 continues to plow under wood pilings.The next morning Kelly is having breakfast. He pours a cup of coffee when Dennis enters the kitchen tent. He flatly proclaims to Kelly, \"I don't believe Mac was delirious. I saw the D9 operating all by itself. You saw it too, didn't you when it got Beltran?\" Dennis hands Kelly a piece of the rock that started it all. Both agree it's a metallic meteorite. Dennis finally convinces Kelly the D9 must be destroyed. He suggests dynamite. Near camp, Chub and Dutch are refueling the Grader. Dutch tells Chub that they are both likely to join the other two buried near the beach. Kelly and Dennis pull up in the jeep and the four men witness the rogue D9 destroy their camp, tents and all. The four men head up to higher ground and watch the D9 systematically destroy everything in camp. The D9 sits out in the brush as the men survey the damage to camp. Dennis reports that there is enough canned food and water for a couple days - enough until the supply ship arrives in a few days. Dutch finally has his answer, \"Remote control. That's got to be it. That thing is running by remote control.\" Dutch suggests to Kelly and Dennis that someone else must be on the island operating the D9. Kelly decides the four should head for higher ground. They take the two jeeps and the pickup truck. The D9 starts up and follows the men. The pickup truck can't make it up the grade. The men split up. Kelly and Chub explore the higher ground. From the top of the hill Kelly spots the D9 coming up a ravine. Kelly and Chub pile some kindling and douse it with gasoline. Their plan is to build a signal fire in hope of attracting a boat or airplane. They drive away after lighting the fire. Chub has an idea. He suggests ramming the pickup into the bulldozer. All the fuel barrels on the truck will catch fire and that should destroy any rubber parts and melt the electrical wiring. The D9 destroys the signal fire. The D9 ambushes the men. It destroys the pickup truck. Dutch was able to jump free, but Chub was unable to exit the truck before the D9 destroys it. And then there were three graves next to the beach. Dutch is convinced the D9 knew the plan. He tells Kelly, \"It knew. That ambush. It knew what we were gonna do and it did it first.\" Both Dennis and Kelly think Dutch is losing it. The D9's next move is to plow a pile of rocks down on the men on the beach. One rock strikes Dennis. At the second rock fall the three men drive off in the orange jeep. The men wait in a ravine while the D9 lurks in the bushes. They can hear it, but they can't see the hellish thing. They decide to leave.That night Dutch paces back and forth nervously. He notes the sound of the surf. He returns to his midnight swim idea. He asks Dennis, \"What's it doing out there?\" To calm Dutch's frayed nerves, Kelly gives him a bottle of alcohol and suggests he take a nap. The next morning we see an empty liquor bottle and a very drunk Dutch. He drives the jeep off and proclaims, \"I'm going swimming.\" He runs straight into the waiting D9. They face off in a sandy clearing. The D9 heads straight for Dutch, who naturally has trouble starting the jeep engine. The D9 quickly turns the jeep into a 6-inch thick pile of scrap. And then there were two. The D9 chases Kelly and Dennis, who are now on foot. They spot and then run to the Shovel. The D9 backs away to get a running start to attack the Shovel. The D9 jousts with the Shovel, skillfully operated by Dennis. It tries a couple of different angles, but the two machines seem evenly matched. Dennis gets the bucket under the bulldozer's blade, but the strain snaps a cable. The men run to the Grader. They finally deduce that the machine can't be killed, but the entity controlling it can be, but with what? In answer to the question how do you kill a killer, Dennis remarks, \"It's too heavy to hang. It's too big to fit in a gas chamber.\" It is Kelly who suggests electricity - electrocution. They proceed to rig a trap using the generator and metal grating. They plan to use the Grader as bait to lure the D9 onto the grating, which is covered with brown tarps as camouflage. The D9 approaches Kelly, who is now sitting in the Grader. The D9 stops just short of the trap. The D9 turns to face the generator and Dennis standing behind it. Kelly grabs a crowbar and walks over to the monster and taunts it. A well-aimed throw of the crowbar takes out one of the headlights which infuriates the bulldozer. It makes straight for Kelly and right over the trap. Dennis throws the generator switch and fries the machine. It howls and thrashes and lifts and lowers the blade in its death throes. The blade turns a bright blue, then violet. The blade returns to normal color and the humming stops. It would appear to be dead and the two men cautiously approach the D9. Dennis suggests a plausible story to tell the company about the four men dying in a landslide, but Kelly insists on the truth - hard as it will be to explain or believe. Both agree they are glad to be alive. Kelly tosses his red hardhat up in the air. It lands on the D9. End Credits roll over a freeze frame of the D9 and Kelly's hardhat.","yt_trailer_code":"vU73kzrhWig","language":"en","mpa_rating":"","background_image":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/killdozer_1974/background.jpg","background_image_original":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/killdozer_1974/background.jpg","small_cover_image":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/killdozer_1974/small-cover.jpg","medium_cover_image":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/killdozer_1974/medium-cover.jpg","large_cover_image":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/killdozer_1974/large-cover.jpg","state":"ok","torrents":[{"url":"https://yts.mx/torrent/download/DA496B8EC1094E3377F35584FAB1F1A500DB78BD","hash":"DA496B8EC1094E3377F35584FAB1F1A500DB78BD","quality":"720p","type":"bluray","is_repack":"0","video_codec":"x264","bit_depth":"8","audio_channels":"2.0","seeds":15,"peers":0,"size":"677.11 MB","size_bytes":710001295,"date_uploaded":"2024-01-20 00:54:22","date_uploaded_unix":1705708462},{"url":"https://yts.mx/torrent/download/07B40FFEA7DB5CFA6A4074C99CE222053360F57B","hash":"07B40FFEA7DB5CFA6A4074C99CE222053360F57B","quality":"1080p","type":"bluray","is_repack":"0","video_codec":"x264","bit_depth":"8","audio_channels":"2.0","seeds":33,"peers":0,"size":"1.23 GB","size_bytes":1320702444,"date_uploaded":"2024-01-20 01:43:37","date_uploaded_unix":1705711417}],"date_uploaded":"2024-01-20 00:54:22","date_uploaded_unix":1705708462},{"id":59338,"url":"https://yts.mx/movies/metalstorm-the-destruction-of-jared-syn-1983","imdb_code":"tt0085935","title":"Metalstorm: The Destruction of Jared-Syn","title_english":"Metalstorm: The Destruction of Jared-Syn","title_long":"Metalstorm: The Destruction of Jared-Syn (1983)","slug":"metalstorm-the-destruction-of-jared-syn-1983","year":1983,"rating":3.9,"runtime":84,"genres":["Action","Adventure","Romance","Sci-Fi"],"summary":"A seeker named Dogen rescues Dhyana after her father is murdered by the evil Jared-Syn.

Abby is deeply disturbed that the picture of David that Raymond is holding is not the same picture she found during an earlier visit to David's bedroom.Abby once again goes to David's bedroom, where she finds a picture drawn by a boy named Tyler, and learns of the existence of another boy named Alexsei. Abby grabs some pictures of them as evidence.It seems that Munchausen syndrome by proxy has led to Eve killing a number of foster sons. Abby realizes that she and Ethan have to save themselves from Eve before she can kill them.Abby gets Ethan, who is still sick, outside of the house and inside of a car, and then Abby sees Raymond returning home. Abby rushes Ethan back to his bedroom. Abby promises Ethan that she'll go get Ben, and bring him back with her.In a hallway, a furious Eve finds Abby, and shakes her, causing the pictures to drop to the floor. Eve viciously smacks Abby, drags her into the nearby attic, kicks her to the floor, and locks her in.After a while, Eve brings some food to Abby, and leaves. Abby thinks it might be spiked with whatever's making Ethan sick. Later, Eve comes back in and tells Abby that if she doesn't eat, then Eve will never let Abby out of the room.Later, Eve leaves another meal in the room, and walks away. Abby grabs a screwdriver, and starts trying to pry off the board that covers the window. Later, Eve injects Ethan with something, and then she sprays heavy-duty oven cleaner on his back to make it look like a rash has appeared.Abby pries the board off, and she sees Ben pulling in. Raymond comes in, and tells Abby that if she makes one sound, he'll kill Ben. Raymond answers the door and tries to make an excuse to keep Ben from coming in, but Ben wants to come in and look around. Ben asks where Ethan's room is, and Raymond leads him to a bedroom that no one is in.Ben, who is becoming suspicious, decides to leave, and Abby is trying to pry the window opened, and she manages to cut away a small section of glass. Raymond, who heard the sound of the piece of glass dropping, goes back in and tells Eve that Ben left.Abby breaks out the rest of the window, and gets out of the attic. Abby goes to Ethan's room, and Eve, listening via an intercom, hears Abby telling Ethan that they're getting out of there.Eve goes to the kitchen, grabs a meat cleaver, and goes to Ethan's room, but she doesn't see Abby. Eve starts searching for Abby, who goes outside. Eve goes out onto a balcony, and sees Abby. The phone starts ringing, and Eve gets to it first. It's Ben, who immediately hangs up.Ben, who is just down the hill from the house, has started suspecting Eve and Raymond of child endangerment, so he called to make sure they're home. Ben alerts his colleagues at the LAPD. Over the house's intercom, Eve tells Abby that she's not going anywhere.Abby goes out to the garage, and starts up the SUV, but she gets out of it so she can open the garage door. Raymond grabs her, throws her down, and tells her that she just can't leave.Abby hits Raymond on the head with a wrench, knocking him out. Abby runs, and Eve finds Raymond out cold. Eve turns off the SUV, and takes the keys. Eve walks away.Ben finds Raymond out cold. Ben goes inside, and Eve stabs him in the neck with a hypodermic needle, injecting him with something that makes him collapse. Abby goes back to Ethan's room, and he's not there.Abby hides under the bed when she hears Eve coming. Eve doesn't find Abby in the room, so Eve leaves to continue searching. Abby gets out from under the bed. Eve goes to Abby's room, and Abby hears her telling Ethan to stay there.After Eve leaves Abby's room, Abby heads to the room, and doesn't see Ethan there. Eve has tricked Abby into coming out of hiding. Eve comes in with the cleaver, and they struggle with each other. Abby forces the cleaver out of Eve's hand.They end up on the landing at the top of the stairs to the room, where Eve tries to push Abby over the railing. But Abby knocks Eve down the metal stairs, and Eve takes a blow to the head.Ben wakes up, and he sees the needle that Eve stabbed him with. Abby finds Ethan in a bathtub of hot water, with his face partially submerged. That's how Eve made it look like David drowned in the lake.With the bathtub filling, Abby gets Ethan out of the tub, and realizes that he's conscious -- he didn't breathe in much water at all. Eve comes up behind Abby, who screams.Eve knocks Abby to the floor, and raises the cleaver. Ben enters with a gun. Before Eve can hit Abby with the cleaver, and before Ben can fire his gun, someone else fires a shot that kills Eve.It was Raymond who fired the shot. It seems that the reason why Raymond reluctantly helped Eve is because he was so blinded by his love for her. Raymond is arrested for his part in endangering Abby and Ethan.Abby and Ben ride to the hospital in the ambulance with Ethan. They'll be living with Ben.","yt_trailer_code":"VzDkftCGLWQ","language":"en","mpa_rating":"R","background_image":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/glass_house_the_good_mother_2006/background.jpg","background_image_original":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/glass_house_the_good_mother_2006/background.jpg","small_cover_image":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/glass_house_the_good_mother_2006/small-cover.jpg","medium_cover_image":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/glass_house_the_good_mother_2006/medium-cover.jpg","large_cover_image":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/glass_house_the_good_mother_2006/large-cover.jpg","state":"ok","torrents":[{"url":"https://yts.mx/torrent/download/784EAEA76B9D142F5E654D04297567220F8DF949","hash":"784EAEA76B9D142F5E654D04297567220F8DF949","quality":"720p","type":"web","is_repack":"0","video_codec":"x264","bit_depth":"8","audio_channels":"2.0","seeds":41,"peers":6,"size":"860.27 MB","size_bytes":902058476,"date_uploaded":"2024-02-02 18:10:54","date_uploaded_unix":1706893854},{"url":"https://yts.mx/torrent/download/3FAE3503CAABFEADC6777316AC204C0D569E3137","hash":"3FAE3503CAABFEADC6777316AC204C0D569E3137","quality":"1080p","type":"web","is_repack":"0","video_codec":"x264","bit_depth":"8","audio_channels":"5.1","seeds":49,"peers":9,"size":"1.72 GB","size_bytes":1846835937,"date_uploaded":"2024-02-02 19:26:21","date_uploaded_unix":1706898381}],"date_uploaded":"2024-02-02 18:10:54","date_uploaded_unix":1706893854},{"id":59568,"url":"https://yts.mx/movies/j-revolusi-2017","imdb_code":"tt6505826","title":"J Revolusi","title_english":"J Revolusi","title_long":"J Revolusi (2017)","slug":"j-revolusi-2017","year":2017,"rating":4.9,"runtime":105,"genres":["Action","Adventure","Thriller"],"summary":"","description_full":"","synopsis":"","yt_trailer_code":"","language":"ms","mpa_rating":"","background_image":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/j_revolusi_2017/background.jpg","background_image_original":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/j_revolusi_2017/background.jpg","small_cover_image":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/j_revolusi_2017/small-cover.jpg","medium_cover_image":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/j_revolusi_2017/medium-cover.jpg","large_cover_image":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/j_revolusi_2017/large-cover.jpg","state":"ok","torrents":[{"url":"https://yts.mx/torrent/download/FAE99A76110D0EFF7C1C120FC3674245C6654B8D","hash":"FAE99A76110D0EFF7C1C120FC3674245C6654B8D","quality":"720p","type":"web","is_repack":"0","video_codec":"x264","bit_depth":"8","audio_channels":"2.0","seeds":22,"peers":6,"size":"1014.03 MB","size_bytes":1063287521,"date_uploaded":"2024-02-02 10:11:55","date_uploaded_unix":1706865115},{"url":"https://yts.mx/torrent/download/26F1308405A8CE1396D9C7166D76403950F99047","hash":"26F1308405A8CE1396D9C7166D76403950F99047","quality":"1080p","type":"web","is_repack":"0","video_codec":"x264","bit_depth":"8","audio_channels":"2.0","seeds":24,"peers":6,"size":"1.84 GB","size_bytes":1975684956,"date_uploaded":"2024-02-02 11:35:04","date_uploaded_unix":1706870104}],"date_uploaded":"2024-02-02 10:11:55","date_uploaded_unix":1706865115},{"id":59564,"url":"https://yts.mx/movies/the-tigers-apprentice-2024","imdb_code":"tt5834410","title":"The Tiger's Apprentice","title_english":"The Tiger's Apprentice","title_long":"The Tiger's Apprentice (2024)","slug":"the-tigers-apprentice-2024","year":2024,"rating":5.5,"runtime":84,"genres":["Action","Adventure","Animation","Comedy","Family","Fantasy","Thriller"],"summary":"The story centers on a normal boy, Tom, who gets drawn into this world against his wishes when his eccentric grandmother who he lives with in San Francisco's Chinatown turns out to be the guardian of the phoenix egg.

peasant woman from a remote Muslim village in Western Bosnia, searches for the remains of her husband and her teenage son, who were taken by Serbian paramilitary forces and executed. Using DNA analysis, the UN Committee for Missing Persons manages to identify the remains of her husband in one of the mass graves, but the Committee still can't identify the remains of her son, since Halima refuses to give a blood sample for DNA testing. There is something that the Committee doesn't know, something that Halima is hiding from others: her beloved son wasn't actually her biological son. The story takes us back two decades ago, during the period of Yugoslavia, where we learn how Halima and her husband became adoptive parents, after fruitless efforts to have a child on their own. Along with that story, we follow Halima's path nowadays while she is searching for the biological mother of her son, the only person who can give a blood sample, to help identify the remains of her adopted son. We learn that the biological mother of Halima's son is her own niece, her brother's daughter, who had an affair with a Serbian boyfriend from a nearby village. Since Halima's brother strongly disapproved of his teenage daughter's relationship with a Christian boy, his daughter has secretly given the unwanted child to her aunt Halima, hiding this from the others, and more importantly, from her own Serbian boyfriend who thought that the baby had died. As Halima searches for her estranged niece, who now lives in the Serbian controlled part of the Bosnia with her husband and three daughters and doesn't want to have any links to her previous life, Halima discovers a horrifying fact from her worst nightmares which stops her from searching further. Still, with this discovery, the spiral of tragic events from the past would continue in the present, disrupting once again the troubled lives of the characters.—anonymous","description_full":"After the end of the war in Bosnia, Halima, a good-natured peasant woman from a remote Muslim village in Western Bosnia, searches for the remains of her husband and her teenage son, who were taken by Serbian paramilitary forces and executed.

However, they discover that Lowbelly will only cry pearls when he hears the music live, so the two villains now intend to kidnap the band members as well!—Anthony Pereyra {hypersonic91@yahoo.com}","yt_trailer_code":"vyOCHDZxxUo","language":"en","mpa_rating":"","background_image":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/gumby_the_movie_1995/background.jpg","background_image_original":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/gumby_the_movie_1995/background.jpg","small_cover_image":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/gumby_the_movie_1995/small-cover.jpg","medium_cover_image":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/gumby_the_movie_1995/medium-cover.jpg","large_cover_image":"https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/gumby_the_movie_1995/large-cover.jpg","state":"ok","torrents":[{"url":"https://yts.mx/torrent/download/6EA5F4A71E0A101D0809271D5112293DD1099D7A","hash":"6EA5F4A71E0A101D0809271D5112293DD1099D7A","quality":"720p","type":"bluray","is_repack":"0","video_codec":"x264","bit_depth":"8","audio_channels":"2.0","seeds":26,"peers":2,"size":"815.19 MB","size_bytes":854788669,"date_uploaded":"2024-01-24 23:11:18","date_uploaded_unix":1706134278},{"url":"https://yts.mx/torrent/download/ED6EF6B3147E157C9C3BCD7B5439E31DA7143AAB","hash":"ED6EF6B3147E157C9C3BCD7B5439E31DA7143AAB","quality":"1080p","type":"bluray","is_repack":"0","video_codec":"x264","bit_depth":"8","audio_channels":"2.0","seeds":53,"peers":9,"size":"1.48 GB","size_bytes":1589137900,"date_uploaded":"2024-01-25 00:15:58","date_uploaded_unix":1706138158}],"date_uploaded":"2024-01-24 23:11:18","date_uploaded_unix":1706134278},{"id":59284,"url":"https://yts.mx/movies/how-the-west-was-fun-1994","imdb_code":"tt0110068","title":"How the West Was Fun","title_english":"How the West Was Fun","title_long":"How the West Was Fun (1994)","slug":"how-the-west-was-fun-1994","year":1994,"rating":4.8,"runtime":96,"genres":["Comedy","Family","Western"],"summary":"8-year-old twins Susie (Mary-Kate Olsen) and Jessica (Ashley Olsen) live with their widowed father Stephen since their mom's death the previous year.

Rebel leader and self-appointed General Mongo (Francisco Bódalo) soon arrives on the scene and recruits El Vasco into his revolutionary gang. However, Mongo is more interested in gaining fortune for himself than for his country. Yodlaf Peterson (Franco Nero), a Swedish mercenary, arrives in Mexico to sell guns to General Mongo. The safe containing the money is locked and only Professor Xantos (Fernando Rey) knows the combination. Xantos is the leader of a student counter-revolution that opposes violence, and is held in a prison by the United States army, after he tried to find funding from the US and did not agree to give the monopoly of his country's entire oil wealth in return. El Vasco dislikes the suit-wearing Peterson and calls him a \"penguin\", but at the suggestion of General Mongo, the two reluctantly join forces and set out to capture Xantos. Their task is made harder by the American army looking for rebel leader Pancho Villa and a wooden-armed American named John Svedese (Jack Palance), who wants to exact revenge on Peterson, his former business partner.
